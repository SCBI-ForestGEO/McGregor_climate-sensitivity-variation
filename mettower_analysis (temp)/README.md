# Met Data (temp)

These files are being stored here for the time being until the shutdown ends, when I'll get guidance from Krista about if these should be in the [climate](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Met_Station_Data/SCBI/ForestGEO_met_station-SCBI) repo.

- 2018_weather_stats = graphs of the main data points from 2018 met data

- Rscript = code that formats the raw metdata into a usable format in R, plus code to make graphs for the year

- metadata = a csv of the metadata pdf, since there wasn't metadata in this format (I figured this was easier to use/more accessible)
