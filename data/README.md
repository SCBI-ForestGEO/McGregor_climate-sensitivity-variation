# README

This folder contains the data used for the analyses.

Specifically,
- `climate` contains PDSI and weather data used for historical climate.
- `core files` has the .rwl files for ForestGEO plot tree cores.
- `heights` contains raw height measurements as taken from the NEON data portal for SCBI
- `physical` contains the topographic wetness index raster, as well as downloaded and formatted NEON height data and plots. These latter `.Rdata` files are used for creating Fig. 2 and have been kept to avoid redownloading the NEON data within R.
- `traits` contains SCBI bark depth.
