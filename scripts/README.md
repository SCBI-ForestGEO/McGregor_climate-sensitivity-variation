# README

This folder contains the scripts used for the main analysis. For questions about scripts, please contact Dr. Anderson-Teixeira (teixeirak@si.edu).

Specifically,
- `canopy_heights` = calculate past heights of different ForestGEO species from regression
- `climate_sensitivity_analysis` = primary analyses for the paper
- `graphs_for_manuscript` = code for creating plots in the manuscript
- `plot_time_series` = code for creating Fig. 1a
- `tables_for_manuscript` = script for an unedited Table 2. Most of the tables are created from `climate_sensitivity_analysis` and manually improved for the manuscript.
- `vertical_height_neon` = code for creating NEON vertical height profiles as seen in Fig. 2.
