### Abstract
Predicting forest responses to drought is an increasingly critical task under climate change effects.
Part of the problem is due the lack of a set definition of drought in recent studies, while often the effects of biophysical and hydraulic traits are interpreted separately.
In this study, we analyze the interaction between these two trait groups using forest census data from a 25.6-ha ForestGEO plot in Virginia (USA).
Drought periods were defined by both Palmer Drought Severity Indices (PDSI) and their identification from tree-ring records for 12 species representing 97% of woody productivity.
Each drought scenario (1964-66, 1977, 1999), along with the overall trend, was then tested again leaf hyraulic trait measurements and microhabitat biophysical data.
Individual-level growth responses to three droughts  were stronger among taller trees in dominant canopy positions, those in wetter microsites, and for more drought-sensitive species as assessed by leaf traits (turgor loss at less negative leaf water potential, greater shrinkage with leaf dehydration), with substantial variation in the best predictor variables across given droughts. 
We conclude that when droughts occur, large dominant trees, drought-sensitive species, and individuals in wetter microhabitats are likely to be most strongly affected.

### Introduction

Understanding how and why trees respond to drought is critical to predicting forest drought responses and climate change feedbacks. (1 paragraph on this- I have lots of content on this and will add later.)

[Understanding forest responses to drought requires increased functional understanding of the factors that confir individual-level vulnerability or resistance.] Forests are diverse in terms of tree sizes and functional traits, and it is known that trees varying in size and functional traits respond differently to drought (e.g., [@bennett_larger_2015]; REFS). Therefore, in order to understand whole-forest response to drought, we need a functional understanding of how responses vary by tree size, microhabitat, and species. There are 3 fundamental questions that must be addressed:

*First, what drives the observed tendency for large trees to suffer more during drought?*  
[@bennett_larger_2015] showed that in forests globally, large trees suffer greater growth reductions during drought. However, this analysis quantified tree size based on DBH, which has no direct mechanistic meaning. This study proposed two major mechanisms (besides insects) for the observed greater drougth growth reductions of large trees: (1) inherently greater biophysical challenge of being tall; (2) greater exposure of the crowns of large trees. Counteracting these effects, (3) the larger root systems of larger trees may confir an advantage in terms of allowing greater access to water, but it appears that this effect is usually insufficient to offset the costs of height and/or crown exposure.

*Second, how do species' traits--alone and in interaction with tree size--influence drought response?* 
Analyzing drought responses on the species level does not fully explain mechanisms and is not feasible in diverse forests. The solution is a trait-based approach. Leaf hydraulic traits hold more promise than more commonly/traditionally-measured traits such as wood density and SLA ([Medeiros et al. 2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2435.13229)). 

Moreover, there may be an interaction between traits and tree size. It is possible that the pattern observed by [@bennett_larger_2015] could be caused by smaller trees being more drought resistant. Alternatively, larger trees may have more drought-resistant traits as adpatations to greater biophysical challenges.


*Third, are responses similar or variable across individual drought years?*
Droughts are rarely explicitly defined in ecological studies [@slette_how_2019], yet no two droughts are the same. This study addressed this by analyzing trees' resistance to drought within and across three defined drought periods.


*Hypotheses*



**1. Why do larger trees suffer greater growth declines during drought?**


1.0. Consistent with most forests globally [@bennett_larger_2015], larger-diameter trees have lower drought resistance. (Note that Bennett et al. 2015 identified only one study on tree growth responses to drought in the Eastern US temperate deciduous biome. We know little about how tree size shapes drought response in this biome.)

    * P1.0-Drought resistance decreases with DBH at time of drought. (supported most of the time)

1.1. Drought resistance decreases with tree height.

    * P1.1- Drought resistance decreases with height at time of drought, and height is a better predictor than DBH. (supported most of the time)

1.2. Canopy trees have lower drought resistance because they are exposed to higher solar radiation, greater wind speeds, and lower humidity. Alternatively, the generally supressed status of subcanopy trees may be insufficient to override the benefits of their buffered environment during drought. 
    * P1.2a- Canopy position is a better predictor of resistance than height, with trees currently in a dominant canopy position having lowest resistance. (rejected)
    * P1.2b- After accounting for height, trees currently in a dominant canopy position have lowest resistance. (partially supported)

    
1.3. During drought, larger trees are at a relatively smaller disadvantage in drier microenvironments where rooting volume/depth is more important for reliable water access.
  
  * P1.3- There is a negative interactive effect between tree height and topographic water index. (rejected- [issue #45](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/McGregor_climate-sensitivity-variation/issues/45))

**2. How do species' traits--alone and in interaction with tree size--influence drought response?**

2.1. Commonly measured traits including wood density (REFS), leaf mass per area [@abrams_adaptations_1990] [@guerfel_impacts_2009], and ring porosity (Elliot et al. 2015, Friedrichs et al. 2009) have been linked to drought responses and likely correlated with drought resistance in this forest. However, we hypothesize that leaf hydraulic traits such as leaf area shrinkage upon dessication and turgor loss point, which are emerging as potentially more informative traits but whose effect on drought resistance has never been tested (CONFIRM), will prove better predictors.
    * P2.1 - wood density correlates positively drought resistant
    * P2.2 - leaf mass area correlates positively to drought resistance 
    * P2.3 - diffuse porous species are more sensitive than ring porous  
    * P2.4 -leaf area shrinkage upon dessication (PLA) is negatively correlated with drought resistance (supported as one of the best predictors)
    * P2.5 - TLP correlates negatively with drought resistance  (supported as one of the best predictors)
 
2.2. Traits vary with microenvironment, with more drought-resistant traits associated to taller trees (and drier topographic positions) ([issue #43](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/McGregor_climate-sensitivity-variation/issues/43))

     * P2.2a- traits (all 5 above) correlate with tree height 
     * (P2.2b- traits (all 5 above) correlate with TWI)
   
2.3. Size-dependent drought resistance is driven by--or alternatively, buffered by--functional traits (i.e., larger trees have more drought vulnerable traits).
    * P2.3 Inclusion of traits in the statistical model does not eliminate or significantly reduce effect of tree size (or TWI). That is, the effects of height and and microhabitat will not be negated in the best model including size, microhabitat, and traits.  (supported)

**3. Did responses vary across droughts?**
3.1 Overall community response is proportional to the severity of each drought.

    * P3.1 -  (How do you define severity? min PDSI? duration? it may be tricky to find the right metric, but I agree that its interesting to compare across droughts)
    
3.2. Predictor variables varied across droughts.

    * P3.2 - There will be overall consistnecy in terms of the directions of responses to predictor variables; however, the best set of predictor variables will vary across droughts.

### Methods
*Study site*
Research was conducted at the 25.6 ha ForestGEO (Global Earth Observatory) study plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Virginia, USA (38°53'36.6"N, 78° 08'43.4"W) [@andersonteixeira_ctfs-forestgeo:_2015]. SCBI is located in the central Appalachian Mountains at the northern edge of Shenandoah National Park.  Elevations range from 273-338m above sea level [@gonzalezakre_patterns_2016] with a topographic relief of 65m [@bourg_initial_2013]. Dominant species include *Liriodendron tulipifera*,  oaks (*Quercus* spp.), and hickories (*Carya* spp.).

*Data collection and preparation*
The SCBI ForestGEO plot was censused in 2008, 2013, and 2018 following standard ForestGEO protocols, whereby all free-standing woody stems >= 1cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were mapped, tagged, measured at DBH, and identified to species [@condit_tropical_1998]. From this census data, we used measurements of DBH from 2008 to calculate historical DBH (described below), along with tree location in the plot to determine the topographic wetness index. *I think that's it, really, in terms of data we're using coming from the censuses.*

We analyzed tree-ring data from the twelve species contributing most to woody aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), which together comprised 97% of study plot ANPP between 2008 and 2013 [@helcoski_growing_2019]. Cores were obtained in 2010-2011 or 2016-2017 from a breast height of 1.3m using a 5mm increment borer. In 2010-2011, cores were collected from randomly selected live trees were selected at random from each species, with at least 30 of those trees having a diameter at breast height (DBH) of at least 10cm [@bourg_initial_2013]. In 2016-2017, cores were collected from all dead trees found in the annual mortality census [@gonzalezakre_patterns_2016]. Cores were sanded, measured, and cross-dated using standard procedures, as detailed in [@helcoski_growing_2019]. The resulting chronologies have been [published](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/climate_sensitivity_cores) in association with @helcoski_growing_2019: (ITRDB). *is this a database?* 

Height measurements (n=# trees) were taken by several researchers between 2012 to 2019, and are archived in a public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/tree_dimensions/tree_heights). Measurement methods included manual [@stovall_assessing_2018, NEON], digital rangefinders [@andersonteixeira_size-related_2015], and automatic LiDAR [@stovall_terrestrial_2018]. Rangefinders either used the tangent method (Impulse 200LR, TruPulse 360R) or the sine method (Nikon ForestryPro) for calculating heights. The associated errors for using either method were acknowledged [@larjavaara_measuring_2013]. Species-specific height allometries were developed (Table S# - **ADD THIS TABLE TO SI**). For species that didn't have enough height measurements, heights were calculated from equations derived from all species in the study. 

For each tree, we combined tree-ring records and allometric equations of height and bark thickness to retroactively calculate DBH and estimate height for the years 1950-2009. Prior DBH was estimated using the following equation, using 2008 as the earliest year for having reliable DBH measurements:

$$ diamYEAR = dbh2008 - 2*(bark.depth2008) - 2*\Sigma(ring.widthYEAR:ring.width2008) + 2*(bark.depthYEAR) $$

Here, *ring.width* was measured from cores. Bark thickness was estimated from species-specific allometries based on the bark thickness data of [@andersonteixeira_size-related_2015].
Specifically, we used linear regression equations on log-transformed data to relate bark thickness to DBH (Table S#- **create table to give these equations in SI**) and then used these to estimate bark thickness based on DBH. 

Crown positions were recorded in the field during the growing season of 2018 following the crown position protocol from [@jennings_assessing_1999], whereby positions were ranked as dominant, codominant, intermediate, or suppressed. As there was no way to retroactively estimate crown position, we assumed that 2018 crown position was reflective of each tree's position over the past 60 years. While some trees undoubtedly changed position, an analysis of crown position relative to height (Fig. XX) and height change since *1959* indicated that change was likely slow. [**work on this-- provide details?**]

Topographic wetness index (TWI) was calculated using the [@R-dynatopmodel] package in R.

Hydraulic traits were collected from SCBI and are summarized in Table 1. In August 2018, we collected leaf samples from three individuals of each species ... (**Nobby's description of methods for the following**)

*Climate and drought years*
[**add description of climate data used in Fig. 1, NEON vertical profiles**]

To accurately understand climate sensitivity, this study used a specific definition of drought, which is not a common practice [@slette_how_2019]. We used the pointRes package [@R-pointRes] in R (version 3.5.3) to determine drought periods based on trees' drought resistance, which is defined by [@lloret_components_2011] as the ratio between the performance during and before the disturbance. Candidate drought years were defined if >50% of the cored trees experienced <30% growth in a year compared to the previous 5 years. These were then cross-validated with the regional Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) values for each year, which yielded a set of three periods that were consistently shown as drought: 1964-1966, 1977, and 1999.

### Results
Once the data was collected, linear mixed models were run following the order of the hypotheses as seen in Figure ??? [individual_tested_traits]. Using the [@R-pointRes] package, we set up models with the resistance value as the response variable, and each prediction's variable as the independent variable. Variables' importance in predicting drought tolerance was calculated from mixed-effects models and the lowest AICc [@R-lme4, @R-AICcmodavg].Null models were determined in order of the predictions. First, we analyzed the combined scenario to determine if "year" was significant. Upon establishing this, we tested height and DBH as size parameters. Although both were significant, height was kept due to its larger delta AICc compared with the null model. We then tested the remaining biophysical and hydraulic traits individually against a null model containing height and year. This yielded Figure ??? (cand_full). All variables with dAICc >2 were used as candidates for each scenario's best model (figure ???? (tested_traits_best))

```

### Discussion

*1. paragraph summarizing main results--> primary conclusions*
When including only biophysical traits, trees' resistance value (on a per-species basis) is explained best by crown position and height, with codominant trees being the most resistant to drought. This follows on work done by [@bennett_larger_2015] [and others?] which show that larger trees suffer more during drought, and confirms that this susceptibility can be seen in tree ring analyses. Adding in crown position with the leaf hydraulic traits yields a slightly worse predictive model for drought tolerance, with height remaining as the only significant biophysical variable.


We partially supported the hypothesis that crown exposure makes trees more vulnerable to drought. Co-dominant trees had the highest drought resistance. Dominant trees had lower resistance, likely because they are the most exposed. Other studies have found clear evidence of greater drought sensitivity in trees with exposed crowns (e.g., [@suarez_factors_2004]; [@scharnweber_confessions_2019]). At the same time, intermediate and suppressed trees had even lower resistance. This indicates that other mechanisms such as competition or rooting depth were important. (Also note that our study design was not ideal for testing the role of canopy position. Current canopy position is a conservative separator of canopy position: trees may currently be in more dominant positions than they were at the time, but backwards movement is unlikely. This would bias against finding a signficant effect for H1.2. Height may be a more reliable predictor of past canopy position than is current canopy position, and explains a portion of variation in canopy position.)

Proximity to stream--either vertical (elev) or horizontal (distance)-- did not increase drought resistance; rather, it tended to decrease resistance (H1.3a). This may be because individuals growing further from water are acclimatized to drier conditions. However, the increase in drought resistance with distance from stream was less for small than large trees (H1.3b), indicating a potential importance of root depth/volume in conferring drought resistance.



**misc content to integrate**
From [@kannenberg_linking_2019], species with diffuse porous wood anatomy (*Liriodendron*) are more sensitive to drought, whereas ring-porous are not as affected because they more easily rebuild structures for hydraulic conductivity. This paper mentions it would be good to have this data with respect to latent affects from drought.

*p50 and p80*
We decided to include values of P50 and P80 in the leaf traits model, defined by [@anderegg_meta-analysis_2016] as the water potentials at which a species loses 50% and 88% [80% by proxy], respectively, of hydraulic conductivity. Values were calculated by (**insert new methods here??**), and were only available for six species (*C. glabra*, *L. tulipifera*, *Q. alba*, *Q. prinus*, *Q. rubra*, and *Q. velutina*). Because of this, the model runs were considered to be incomplete due to the exclusion of the other 8 species. Results revealed neither p50 nor p80 to be significant, thus for the full analysis we decided to drop the two traits in order to include all species in the full analysis.
