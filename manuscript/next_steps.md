# Remaining steps for paper

## Data
- [ ] figure out p50 and p80 values, add in as traits (need input from nobby)


## Models
- run models with only leaf traits
- run models with no leaf traits, only biophysical
- run the models with regard to how we want to present the data
  i. decide how we want to parse out the different elements for determining success of each hypothesis:
      a. have best model as null, then taking out each focus variable to show how the model is impacted?
      b. have the full model as null, then looking at each focus variable?
      c. we mentioned that for the size hypothesis, we should not include specific leaf traits (e.g.) in model because inherently, these are represented by the different species anyways
      
## Writing
- get familiar with rmarkdown for putting all the writing together
- have methods well-documented
- write discussion
- update results table
- determine figures to be used

## Journal
- think of journals to submit to, see specifications
