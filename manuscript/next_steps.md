# Remaining steps for paper

## Data
- get word from NEON about data issues, and prepare height data for integration with ours
- finish issues brought up in #25 and #26
- get leaf foliar traits from neon? see issue #16
- address issue #24


## Models
- run models with leaf traits, new height data, get best model
- run the models with regard to how we want to present the data
  i. decide how we want to parse out the different elements for determining success of each hypothesis:
      a. have best model as null, then taking out each focus variable to show how the model is impacted?
      b. have the full model as null, then looking at each focus variable?
      c. we mentioned that for the size hypothesis, we should not include specific leaf traits (e.g.) in model because inherently, these are represented by the different species anyways
      
## Writing
- get familiar with rmarkdown for putting all the writing together
- have methods well-documented
- write discussion
- update results table
- determine figures to be used

## Journal
- think of journals to submit to, see specifications
