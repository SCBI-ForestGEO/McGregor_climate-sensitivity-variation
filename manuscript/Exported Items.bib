	abstract = {The IPCC previsions for the upcoming decades include an increase in frequency and intensity of drought events in several regions worldwide, including Northern Europe. Drought significantly affects forest ecosystems through decreased productivity, increased vulnerability to biotic disturbances and increased subsequent mortality. How forest ecosystems maintain resistance and resilience to drought events are important questions. Our study aimed to assess whether species mixture or an individual tree size within a stand alters a given tree’s resilience and resistance to drought. A retrospective study of tree-ring widths allowed us to calculate resistance, resilience and recovery indices for five recent drought events: 1976, the 1990–1992 period, 2003, 2006 and 2010. These drought events were selected based on the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) drought index. Our study sample consisted of 108 individual sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.)) or Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees sampled in 2012 and 2013 (Orleans forest, central France) in pure and mixed stands, divided into three diameter classes corresponding to three sizes: large, medium and small trees. Scots pine performed better than sessile oak during the 1990–1992 and 2010 droughts while the contrary was observed for the 2003 and 2006 droughts. They performed equally in 1976. We suggest that the differing sensitivity of the two species to spring and summer drought explained this result. In our study, stand composition had no effect on resilience or resistance for either species. The size effect in oaks was unclear as small oaks displayed either a better performance or a worse performance than large oaks. Small pines displayed better resistance and resilience than pines of a larger size. This work stressed the importance of taking into account stand composition and trees size as well as soil and climatic conditions for each drought events to achieve a better understanding of the diversity of responses to climatic variations among forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Drought-related tree mortality is now a widespread phenomenon predicted to increase in magnitude with climate change. However, the patterns of which species and trees are most vulnerable to drought, and the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive, in part due to the lack of relevant data and difficulty of predicting the location of catastrophic drought years in advance. We used long-term demographic records and extensive databases of functional traits and distribution patterns to understand the responses of 20–53 species to an extreme drought in a seasonally dry tropical forest in Costa Rica, which occurred during the 2015 El Niño Southern Oscillation event. Overall, species-specific mortality rates during the drought ranged from 0\% to 34\%, and varied little as a function of tree size. By contrast, hydraulic safety margins correlated well with probability of mortality among species, while morphological or leaf economics spectrum traits did not. This firmly suggests hydraulic traits as targets for future research.},
