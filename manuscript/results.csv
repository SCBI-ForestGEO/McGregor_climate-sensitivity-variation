However, the coefficients show that resistance value decreases as you move to the subcanopy (but barely - 0.000007). Given that this is not the best model, though, I'm not sure how to write this as a response"

Here, the response is good with the prediction, where the relationship between canopy and subcanopy is much stronger than 1.2a above (subcanopy does have lower resistance values than canopy). However, the effect of height is still stronger."
