	abstract = {In tall old forests, limitations to water transport may limit maximum tree height and reduce photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. We evaluated the degree to which tall trees could potentially compensate for hydraulic limitations to water transport by increased use of water stored in xylem. Using sap flux measurements in three tree species of the Pacific Northwest, we showed that reliance on stored water increases with tree size and estimated that use of stored water increases photosynthesis. For Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), water stored in xylem accounted for 20 to 25\% of total daily water use in 60-m trees, whereas stored water comprised 7\% of daily water use in 15-m trees. For Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana Dougl. ex Hook.), water stored in xylem accounted for 10 to 23\% of total daily water use in 25-m trees, whereas stored water comprised 9 to 13\% of daily water use in 10-m trees. For ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.), water stored in xylem accounted for 4 to 20\% of total daily water use in 36-m trees, whereas stored water comprised 2 to 4\% of daily water use in 12-m trees. In 60-m Douglas-fir trees, we estimated that use of stored water supported 18\% more photosynthesis on a daily basis than would occur if no stored water were used, whereas 15-m Douglas-fir trees gained 10\% greater daily photosynthesis from use of stored water. We conclude that water storage plays a significant role in the water and carbon economy of tall trees and old forests.},

	abstract = {Components of the tree water transport pathway; roots, trunks, branches and leaves; can also serve as water storage compartments and therefore act transiently as intermediate sources of water for transpiring leaves. However, most previous work has focused on gradual depletion and recharge of tree internal water reserves as soil water availability varies over seasonal cycles. This chapter focuses on the underappreciated role that internal water storage plays in stabilizing the physiological function of trees under the dynamic conditions that prevail over the course of a day. Capacitive discharge of water into the transpiration stream can buffer daily fluctuations in xylem tension, thereby diminishing the risk of xylem embolism and hydraulic failure under dynamic conditions. Intrinsic sapwood capaci­t­ance and reliance on stored water increase with tree size. An inverse relationship between sapwood capacitance and resistance to embolism across diverse woody species suggests that above a minimum threshold value of capacitance, the tree survives by using capacitance to provide hydraulic safety by buffering fluctuations in tension, rather by relying on xylem structural features that directly reduce vulnerability to embolism. Progress in understanding the physiological role of capacitance in trees is impeded by non-uniformity in the way capacitance is measured and expressed, preventing much of the available information from being synthesized. To remedy this, standard protocols are described for defining and expressing capacitance and water storage capacity.},

Here, we pair a dataset of 143 tree ring chronologies across the mesic forests of the eastern US with historical climate and local soil properties. We found legacy effects to be widespread, the magnitude of which increased markedly in diffuse porous species, sites with deep water tables, and in response to late-season droughts (August–September). Using an ensemble of downscaled climate projections, we additionally show that our sites are projected to drastically increase in water deficit and drought frequency by the end of the century, potentially increasing the size of legacy effects by up to 65\% and acting as a significant process shaping forest composition, carbon uptake and mortality.},

	abstract = {The response of small understory trees to long-term drought is vital in determining the future composition, carbon stocks and dynamics of tropical forests. Long-term drought is, however, also likely to expose understory trees to increased light availability driven by drought-induced mortality. Relatively little is known about the potential for understory trees to adjust their physiology to both decreasing water and increasing light availability. We analysed data on maximum photosynthetic capacity (Jmax, Vcmax), leaf respiration (Rleaf), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf thickness and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations from 66 small trees across 12 common genera at the world’s longest running tropical rainfall exclusion experiment and compared responses to those from 61 surviving canopy trees. Small trees increased Jmax, Vcmax, Rleaf and LMA (71\%, 29\%, 32\%, 15\% respectively) in response to the drought treatment, but leaf thickness and leaf nutrient concentrations did not change. Small trees were significantly more responsive than large canopy trees to the drought treatment, suggesting greater phenotypic plasticity and resilience to prolonged drought, although differences among taxa were observed. Our results highlight that small tropical trees have greater capacity to respond to ecosystem level changes and have the potential to regenerate resilient forests following future droughts.

	abstract = {© Author(s) 2016. Forest ecosystem models based on heuristic water stress functions poorly predict tropical forest response to drought partly because they do not capture the diversity of hydraulic traits (including variation in tree size) observed in tropical forests. We developed a continuous porous media approach to modeling plant hydraulics in which all parameters of the constitutive equations are biologically interpretable and measurable plant hydraulic traits (e.g., turgor loss point πtlp, bulk elastic modulus ϵ, hydraulic capacitance Cft, xylem hydraulic conductivity ks,max, water potential at 50\% loss of conductivity for both xylem (P50,x) and stomata (P50,gs), and the leafg: sapwood area ratio Al: As). We embedded this plant hydraulics model within a trait forest simulator (TFS) that models light environments of individual trees and their upper boundary conditions (transpiration), as well as providing a means for parameterizing variation in hydraulic traits among individuals. We synthesized literature and existing databases to parameterize all hydraulic traits as a function of stem and leaf traits, including wood density (WD), leaf mass per area (LMA), and photosynthetic capacity (Amax), and evaluated the coupled model (called TFS v.1-Hydro) predictions, against observed diurnal and seasonal variability in stem and leaf water potential as well as stand-scaled sap flux. Our hydraulic trait synthesis revealed coordination among leaf and xylem hydraulic traits and statistically significant relationships of most hydraulic traits with more easily measured plant traits. Using the most informative empirical trait-trait relationships derived from this synthesis, TFS v.1-Hydro successfully captured individual variation in leaf and stem water potential due to increasing tree size and light environment, with model representation of hydraulic architecture and plant traits exerting primary and secondary controls, respectively, on the fidelity of model predictions. The plant hydraulics model made substantial improvements to simulations of total ecosystem transpiration. Remaining uncertainties and limitations of the trait paradigm for plant hydraulics modeling are highlighted.},

For 43 evergreen tree species ({\textgreater}1 cm dbh) in a 20-ha seasonal tropical rainforest plot in Xishuangbanna, China, we compared the ability of drought-tolerance traits, other physiological traits, and commonly measured functional traits to predict the spatial patterns expected from the assembly processes of habitat associations, niche-overlap-based competition, and hierarchical competition. We distinguished the neighborhood-scale (0–20 m) patterns expected from competition from larger-scale habitat associations with a wavelet method. Species’ drought tolerance and habitat variables related to soil water supply were strong drivers of habitat associations, and drought tolerance showed a significant spatial signal for influencing competition. Overall, the traits most strongly associated with habitat, as quantified using multivariate models, were leaf density, leaf turgor loss point (πtlp; also known as the leaf wilting point), and stem hydraulic conductivity (r2 range for the best fit models = 0.27–0.36). At neighborhood scales, species spatial associations were positively correlated with similarity in πtlp, consistent with predictions for hierarchical competition. Although the correlation between πtlp and interspecific spatial associations was weak (r2 {\textless} 0.01), this showed a persistent influence of drought tolerance on neighborhood interactions and community assembly. Quantifying the full impact of traits on competitive interactions in forests may require incorporating plasticity among individuals within species, especially among specific life stages, and moving beyond individual traits to integrate the impact of multiple traits on whole-plant performance and resource demand.},

We investigated the spatial structure of tropical forest vegetation and its relationship to the hydrological network and associated topographic structure across spatial scales of 10–1000 m using high-resolution maps of LiDAR-derived mean canopy profile height (MCH) and elevation for 4930 ha of tropical forest in central Panama. MCH was strongly associated with the hydrological network: canopy height was highest in areas of positive convexity (valleys, depressions) close to channels draining 1 ha or more. Average MCH declined strongly with decreasing convexity (transition to ridges, hilltops) and increasing distance from the nearest channel. Spectral analysis, performed with wavelet decomposition, showed that the variance in MCH had fractal similarity at scales of ∼30–600 m, and was strongly associated with variation in elevation, with peak correlations at scales of ∼250 m. Whereas previous studies of topographic correlates of tropical forest structure conducted analyses at just one or a few spatial grains, our study found that correlations were strongly scale-dependent. Multi-scale analyses of correlations of MCH with slope, aspect, curvature, and Laplacian convexity found that MCH was most strongly related to convexity measured at scales of 20–300 m, a topographic variable that is a good proxy for position with respect to the hydrological network. Overall, our results support the idea that, even in these mesic forests, hydrological networks and associated topographical variation serve as templates upon which vegetation is organized over specific ranges of scales. These findings constitute an important step towards a mechanistic understanding of these patterns, and can guide upscaling and downscaling.},

	abstract = {Plant hydraulic conductance, namely the rate of water flow inside plants per unit time and unit pressure difference, varies largely from plant to plant and under different environmental conditions. Herein the main factors affecting: (a) the scaling between whole-plant hydraulic conductance and leaf area; (b) the relationship between gas exchange at the leaf level and leaf-specific xylem hydraulic conductance; (c) the short-term physiological regulation of plant hydraulic conductance under conditions of ample soil water, and (d) the long-term structural acclimation of xylem hydraulic conductance to changes in environmental conditions are reviewed. It is shown that plant hydraulic conductance is a highly plastic character that varies as a result of multiple processes acting at several time scales. Across species ranging from coniferous and broad-leaved trees to shrubs, crop and herbaceous species, and desert subshrubs, hydraulic conductance scaled linearly with leaf area, as expected from first principles. Despite considerable convergence in the scaling of hydraulic properties, significant differences were apparent across life forms that underlie their different abilities to conduct gas exchange at the leaf level. A simple model of carbon allocation between leaves and support tissues explained the observed patterns and correctly predicted the inverse relationships with plant height. Therefore, stature appears as a fundamental factor affecting gas exchange across plant life forms. Both short-term physiological regulation and long-term structural acclimation can change the levels of hydraulic conductance significantly. Based on a meta-analysis of the existing literature, any change in environmental parameters that increases the availability of resources (either above- or below-ground) results in the long-term acclimation of a less efficient (per unit leaf area) hydraulic system.},

	abstract = {Phaseolus vulgaris grown under various environmental conditions was used to assess long-term acclimatization of xylem structural characteristics and hydraulic properties. Conduit diameter tended to be reduced and ‘wood’ density (of ‘woody’ stems) increased under low moisture (‘dry’), increased soil porosity (‘porous soil’) and low phosphorus (‘low P’) treatments. Dry and low P had the largest percentage of small vessels. Dry, low light (‘shade’) and porous soil treatments decreased P50 (50\% loss in conductivity) by 0.15–0.25 MPa (greater cavitation resistance) compared with ‘controls’. By contrast, low P increased P50 by 0.30 MPa (less cavitation resistance) compared with porous soil (the control for low P). Changes in cavitation resistance were independent of conduit diameter. By contrast, changes in cavitation resistance were correlated with wood density for the control, dry and porous soil treatments, but did not appear to be a function of wood density for the shade and low P treatments. In a separate experiment comparing control and porous soil plants, stem hydraulic conductivity (kh), specific conductivity (ks), leaf specific conductivity (LSC), total pot water loss, plant biomass and leaf area were all greater for control plants compared to porous soil plants. Porous soil plants, however, demonstrated higher midday stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs), apparently because they experienced proportionally less midday xylem cavitation.},

	abstract = {Climate-induced forest mortality is being widely observed across the globe. Predicting forest mortality remains challenging because the physiological mechanisms causing mortality are not fully understood and empirical relations between climatology and mortality are subject to change. Here, we show that the temporal loss of resilience, a phenomenon often detected as a system approaches a tipping point, can be used as an early warning signal (EWS) to predict the likelihood of forest mortality directly from remotely sensed vegetation dynamics. We tested the proposed approach on data from Californian forests and found that the EWS can often be detected before reduced greenness, between 6 to 19 months before mortality. The EWS shows a species-specific relation with mortality, and is able to capture its spatio-temporal variations. These findings highlight the potential for such an EWS to predict forest mortality in the near-term.},
