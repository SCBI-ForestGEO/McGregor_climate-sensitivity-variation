	abstract = {The relationship between rooting depth and above-ground hydraulic traits can potentially define drought resistance strategies that are important in determining species distribution and coexistence in seasonal tropical forests, and understanding this is important for predicting the effects of future climate change in these ecosystems. We assessed the rooting depth of 12 dominant tree species (representing c. 42\% of the forest basal area) in a seasonal Amazon forest using the stable isotope ratios (δ18O and δ2H) of water collected from tree xylem and soils from a range of depths. We took advantage of a major ENSO-related drought in 2015/2016 that caused substantial evaporative isotope enrichment in the soil and revealed water use strategies of each species under extreme conditions. We measured the minimum dry season leaf water potential both in a normal year (2014; Ψnon-ENSO) and in an extreme drought year (2015; ΨENSO). Furthermore, we measured xylem hydraulic traits that indicate water potential thresholds trees tolerate without risking hydraulic failure (P50 and P88). We demonstrate that coexisting trees are largely segregated along a single hydrological niche axis defined by root depth differences, access to light and tolerance of low water potential. These differences in rooting depth were strongly related to tree size; diameter at breast height (DBH) explained 72\% of the variation in the δ18Oxylem. Additionally, δ18Oxylem explained 49\% of the variation in P50 and 70\% of P88, with shallow-rooted species more tolerant of low water potentials, while δ18O of xylem water explained 47\% and 77\% of the variation of minimum Ψnon-ENSO and ΨENSO. We propose a new formulation to estimate an effective functional rooting depth, i.e. the likely soil depth from which roots can sustain water uptake for physiological functions, using DBH as predictor of root depth at this site. Based on these estimates, we conclude that rooting depth varies systematically across the most abundant families, genera and species at the Tapajós forest, and that understorey species in particular are limited to shallow rooting depths. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and its underlying trade-off related to drought resistance, which also affect the dominance structure of trees in this seasonal eastern Amazon forest. Synthesis. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and demonstrate its underlying trade-off related to drought resistance (access to deep water vs. tolerance of very low water potentials). We found that the single hydrological axis defining water use traits was strongly related to tree size, and infer that periodic extreme droughts influence community composition and the dominance structure of trees in this seasonal eastern Amazon forest.},

	abstract = {Promoting tree species diversity is commonly advocated in the anticipation of predicted increases in drought frequency and severity. However, mixing effects on drought responses vary substantially with site conditions and species identity. We combined annually resolved tree-ring data and repeated forest inventory data spanning the last 90 years to examine the effect of species-specific neighbourhood competition on the drought response (resistance, recovery and resilience) of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) for six drought events that occurred since the 1970s at three sites in Switzerland. We found predominantly weak neighbourhood competition and tree species diversity effects, with significant interspecific influences only for resistance and recovery of beech. These minor neighbourhood effects were outweighed by tree age and size effects. Although age effects depended on species identity and components of resilience, tree size consistently negatively affected all species. Our results emphasize that diversity effects may vary for each given species combination which makes broader conclusions challenging. This is because species interact through their specific set of traits and interactions vary in space and time. Adaptive management strategies are likely to be more effective when they promote more drought-tolerant species and reductions in stand density. Despite the absence of an unequivocal advantage of tree diversity on drought resilience, striving towards species-rich forests nonetheless allows for a risk spreading among multiple species and the reinforced provision of numerous ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Competition effects and management related disturbances can contribute to strong non-climatic signals in ring-width trends of trees from closed canopy forests. Removing this noise comes at the price of losing a considerable amount of (climatic) information on decadal and centennial time scales. Alternatively, open grown solitary trees, which never competed for light or other resources could function as less biased climate proxies. To explore this potential we analysed individual growth trends and climate-growth relationships of solitary oaks, potentially representative of former, open forests, and compared it to those of trees growing in adjacent closed canopy forests. Solitary oaks show differing tree allometry with bigger crowns and lower absolute heights. Their radial growth was significantly higher compared to forest trees. Contrary to our expectations, these solitary oaks show highly individualistic decadal growth trends. Their inter-annual variations are nevertheless in good agreement between individuals and stronger compared to trees from closed canopy forests. Climate –growth analysis revealed a significantly higher drought sensitivity of solitary oaks. Given the typical open medieval forest structure of large trees with extensive crowns growing in a mosaic of grazed woodlands and grasslands, it is likely that these trees contribute to the historical part of tree-ring collections. When trees from today’s denser forests forming the recent parts of the collections are used to calibrate reconstruction models, the differing drought sensitivity might therefore lead to an overestimation of historical droughts.},

Understanding how forests respond is critical to forest conservation and climate protection. This review describes an international network of 59 long-term forest dynamics research sites (CTFS-ForestGEO) useful for characterizing forest responses to global change. Within very large plots (median size 25 ha), all stems ≥1 cm diameter are identified to species, mapped, and regularly recensused according to standardized protocols. CTFS-ForestGEO spans 25°S–61°N latitude, is generally representative of the range of bioclimatic, edaphic, and topographic conditions experienced by forests worldwide, and is the only forest monitoring network that applies a standardized protocol to each of the world's major forest biomes. Supplementary standardized measurements at subsets of the sites provide additional information on plants, animals, and ecosystem and environmental variables. CTFS-ForestGEO sites are experiencing multifaceted anthropogenic global change pressures including warming (average 0.61 °C), changes in precipitation (up to ±30\% change), atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (up to 3.8 g N m−2 yr−1 and 3.1 g S m−2 yr−1), and forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape (up to 88\% reduced tree cover within 5 km). The broad suite of measurements made at CTFS-ForestGEO sites makes it possible to investigate the complex ways in which global change is impacting forest dynamics. Ongoing research across the CTFS-ForestGEO network is yielding insights into how and why the forests are changing, and continued monitoring will provide vital contributions to understanding worldwide forest diversity and dynamics in an era of global change.},

Here, we use a unique data set of mortality in a temperate deciduous forest to characterize rates and drivers of mortality. At the 25.6-ha Center for Tropical Forest Science—Forest Global Earth Observatory forest dynamics plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (Virginia, USA), we conducted two full tree censuses in 2008 and 2013 and then tracked mortality over the next 2 years (2014 and 2015). Overall, the mortality rate, m, of stems ≥10 cm diameter was 1.3–2.1\%/yr. Biomass mortality, M, was 1.9–3.4 Mg·ha−1·yr−1 at the stand level (0.6–1.1\%/yr of biomass), less than biomass gains from growth and recruitment, resulting in net live biomass accumulation. Small stems died at the highest rate; however, contributions to M increased toward larger size classes. Most species had m {\textbackslash}textless 2\%/yr and M {\textbackslash}textless 0.25 Mg·ha−1·yr−1 ({\textbackslash}textless3\%/yr of biomass), whereas two to four species had anomalously high mortality rates during each census period, accounting for 15–24\% of m (n = 2, Cercis canadensis, Ulmus species) and 39–75\% of M (n = 4 Quercus species). Stems that died, whether or not in association with mechanical damage, tended to grow more slowly in preceding years than surviving stems and, for certain shade-intolerant species, tended to be in neighborhoods with higher basal area. These findings show how relatively fine-scale mortality processes contribute to stand-level compositional change and carbon cycling. The mortality patterns reported here will provide a valuable basis for understanding future disturbance events within eastern deciduous forests and for comparing across forest types.},

	abstract = {Forests provide essential ecosystem services and hold approximately 45\% of global terrestrial carbon. Estimates of the quantity and spatial distribution of global forest carbon are built on the assumption that regional- or national-scale allometry accurately captures growth form across the wide spectrum of plant size. Allometry is painstaking and costly to create: trees must be cut, dried, and weighed, over the span of months. This bottleneck has left most equations low in sample size and without large trees ({\textbackslash}textgreater50 cm), which can contain over 40\% of aboveground carbon. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can potentially increase the range and sample size of allometric equations through non-destructive biomass estimation and must be evaluated in this context. We deployed TLS at the Center for Tropical Forest Science - Forest Global Earth Observatory (CTFS-ForestGEO) plot in Front Royal, Virginia and virtually reconstructed 329 trees with diameters up to 123 cm. Three-dimensional tree models were the basis for 22 local allometric relationships for comparison to the Jenkins et al. (2003) and Chojnacky et al. (2014) equations. Overall, TLS allometry had lower RMSE and predicted higher tree-level biomass compared to the equivalent national equations. We evaluated site-wide allometry for errors from insufficient sample size and diameter range. Allometric equations did not stabilize to a consistent set of parameters until 100–200 samples were reached and exclusion of large trees severely limited prediction accuracy. This work implies that current biomass equations may be inadequate and highlights TLS stem modeling as an appropriate method of non-destructive allometric equation development for updating allometry and reducing uncertainty in landscape-level biomass estimates.},

The traditional method, which we refer to as the ‘tangent method’, involves measuring horizontal distance to the tree and angles from horizontal to the top and base of the tree, while standing at a distance of perhaps one tree height or greater. Laser rangefinders enable an alternative method, which we refer to as the ‘sine method’; it involves measuring the distances to the top and base of the tree, and the angles from horizontal to these, and can be carried out from under the tree or from some distance away. We quantified systematic and random errors of these two methods as applied by five technicians to a size-stratified sample of 74 trees between 5.7 and 39.2 m tall in a Neotropical moist forest in Panama. We measured actual heights using towers adjacent to these trees. The tangent method produced unbiased height estimates, but random error was high, and in 6 of the 370 measurements, heights were overestimated by more than 100\%. The sine method was faster to learn, displayed less variation in heights among technicians, and had lower random error, but resulted in systematic underestimation by 20\% on average. We recommend the sine method for most applications in tropical forests. However, its underestimation, which is likely to vary with forest and instrument type, must be corrected if actual heights are needed.},

Site- and region-specific studies suggest that large trees, which play keystone roles in forests6 and can be disproportionately important to ecosystem carbon storage7 and hydrology8, exhibit greater sensitivity to drought than small trees4,5,9,10. Here, we synthesize data on tree growth and mortality collected during 40 drought events in forests worldwide to see whether this size-dependent sensitivity to drought holds more widely. We find that droughts consistently had a more detrimental impact on the growth and mortality rates of larger trees. Moreover, drought-related mortality increased with tree size in 65\% of the droughts examined, especially when community-wide mortality was high or when bark beetles were present. The more pronounced drought sensitivity of larger trees could be underpinned by greater inherent vulnerability to hydraulic stress11,​12,​13,​14, the higher radiation and evaporative demand experienced by exposed crowns4,15, and the tendency for bark beetles to preferentially attack larger trees16. We suggest that future droughts will have a more detrimental impact on the growth and mortality of larger trees, potentially exacerbating feedbacks to climate change.},

	abstract = {Severe drought can cause lagged effects on tree physiology that negatively impact forest functioning for years. These “drought legacy effects” have been widely documented in tree ring records and could have important implications for our understanding of broader-scale forest carbon cycling. However, legacy effects in tree-ring increments may be decoupled from ecosystem fluxes due to 1) post-drought alterations in carbon allocation patterns, 2) temporal asynchrony between radial growth and carbon uptake, and 3) dendrochronological sampling biases. In order to link legacy effects from tree rings to whole forests, we leveraged a rich dataset from a Midwestern US forest that was severely impacted by a drought in 2012. At this site, we compiled tree-ring records, leaf-level gas exchange, eddy flux measurements, dendrometer band data, and satellite remote-sensing estimates of greenness and leaf area before, during, and after the 2012 drought. After accounting for the relative abundance of tree species in the stand, we estimate that legacy effects led to 10\% reductions in tree-ring width increments in the year following the severe drought. Despite this stand-scale reduction in radial growth, we found that leaf-level photosynthesis, gross primary productivity, and vegetation greenness were not suppressed in the year following the 2012 drought. Neither temporal asynchrony between radial growth and carbon uptake nor sampling biases could explain our observations of legacy effects in tree rings but not in gross primary productivity. Instead, elevated leaf-level photosynthesis co-occurred with reduced leaf area in early 2013, indicating that resources may have been allocated away from radial growth in conjunction with post-drought upregulation of photosynthesis and repair of canopy damage. Collectively, our results indicate that tree ring legacy effects were not observed in other canopy processes, and that post-drought canopy allocation could be an important mechanism that decouples tree-ring signals from gross primary productivity.

	abstract = {The climate sensitivity of forest ecosystem woody productivity (ANPPstem) influences carbon cycle responses to climate change. For the first time, we combined long-term annual growth and forest census data of a diverse temperate broadleaf deciduous forest, seeking to resolve whether ANPPstem is primarily moisture- or energy-limited and whether climate sensitivity has changed in recent decades characterised by more mesic conditions and elevated CO2. We analysed tree-ring chronologies across 109 yr of monthly climatic variation (1901–2009) for 14 species representing 97\% of ANPPstem in a 25.6 ha plot in northern Virginia, USA. Radial growth of most species and ecosystem-level ANPPstem responded positively to cool, moist growing season conditions, but the same conditions in the previous May–July were associated with reduced growth. In recent decades (1980–2009), responses were more variable and, on average, weaker. Our results indicated that woody productivity is primarily limited by current growing season moisture, as opposed to temperature or sunlight, but additional complexity in climate sensitivity may reflect the use of stored carbohydrate reserves. Overall, while such forests currently display limited moisture sensitivity, their woody productivity is likely to decline under projected hotter and potentially drier growing season conditions.},

	abstract = {Many morphological, physiological and ecological traits of trees scale with diameter, shaping the structure and function of forest ecosystems. Understanding the mechanistic basis for such scaling relationships is key to understanding forests globally and their role in Earth's changing climate system. Here, we evaluate theoretical predictions for the scaling of nine variables in a mixed-age temperate deciduous forest (CTFS-ForestGEO forest dynamics plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Virginia, USA) and compare observed scaling parameters to those from other forests world-wide. We examine fifteen species and various environmental conditions. Structural, physiological and ecological traits of trees scaled with stem diameter in a manner that was sometimes consistent with existing theoretical predictions – more commonly with those predicting a range of scaling values than a single universal scaling value. Scaling relationships were variable among species, reflecting substantive ecological differences. Scaling relationships varied considerably with environmental conditions. For instance, the scaling of sap flux density varied with atmospheric moisture demand, and herbivore browsing dramatically influenced stem abundance scaling. Thus, stand-level, time-averaged scaling relationships (e.g., the scaling of diameter growth) are underlain by a diversity of species-level scaling relationships that can vary substantially with fluctuating environmental conditions. In order to use scaling theory to accurately characterize forest ecosystems and predict their responses to global change, it will be critical to develop a more nuanced understanding of both the forces that constrain stand-level scaling and the complexity of scaling variation across species and environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Drought-induced tree mortality has been observed globally and is expected to increase under climate change scenarios, with large potential consequences for the terrestrial carbon sink. Predicting mortality across species is crucial for assessing the effects of climate extremes on forest community biodiversity, composition, and carbon sequestration. However, the physiological traits associated with elevated risk of mortality in diverse ecosystems remain unknown, although these traits could greatly improve understanding and prediction of tree mortality in forests. We performed a meta-analysis on species’ mortality rates across 475 species from 33 studies around the globe to assess which traits determine a species’ mortality risk. We found that species-specific mortality anomalies from community mortality rate in a given drought were associated with plant hydraulic traits. Across all species, mortality was best predicted by a low hydraulic safety margin—the difference between typical minimum xylem water potential and that causing xylem dysfunction—and xylem vulnerability to embolism. Angiosperms and gymnosperms experienced roughly equal mortality risks. Our results provide broad support for the hypothesis that hydraulic traits capture key mechanisms determining tree death and highlight that physiological traits can improve vegetation model prediction of tree mortality during climate extremes.},

	abstract = {Recent world-wide episodes of tree dieback have been attributed to increasing temperatures and associated drought. Because these events are likely to become more common, improved knowledge of their cumulative effects on resilience and the ability to recover pre-disturbance conditions is important for forest management. Here we propose several indices to examine components of individual tree resilience based on tree ring growth: resistance (inverse of growth reduction during the episode), recovery (growth increase relative to the minimum growth during the episode), resilience (capacity to reach pre-episode growth levels) and relative resilience (resilience weighted by the damage incurred during the episode). Based on tree ring analyses, we analyzed historical patterns of tree resilience to successive drought-induced low growth periods in ponderosa pine trees growing in unmanaged, remote forests of the Rocky Mountains. Low-growth periods registered in tree rings were related to anomalies in the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and were attributed to drought. Independently of the impact of a specific event, subsequent growth after a single low-growth episode was related to the growth prior to the event. Growth performance differed with tree age: young trees were overall more resistant to low-growth periods, but older trees recovered better from more recent events. Regardless of tree age, recently burned sites exhibited lower post-episode growth and lower resistance and resilience than unburned ones. We found mixed evidence for the cumulative effect of past low-growth episodes: overall, greater impacts of a prior event and greater cumulative effects of past low-growth periods caused a decrease in resistance. However, we did not find a progressive decrease in resilience over time in old trees. Our results highlight the value of using a combination of estimators to evaluate the different components of resilience. Specifically, while tree responses to disturbance depend on past disturbance episodes, the response is context-specific and depends on the impact the capacity to recover after disturbance. This suggests that recent increases in forest mortality under current climate trends could relate to thresholds on specific components of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience itself) rather than to an overall loss of resilience over time. Identifying such thresholds and their underlying mechanisms is a promising area of research with important implications for forest management.},

	abstract = {Drought, widely studied as an important driver of ecosystem dynamics, is predicted to increase in frequency and severity globally. To study drought, ecologists must define or at least operationalize what constitutes a drought. How this is accomplished in practice is unclear, particularly given that climatologists have long struggled to agree on definitions of drought, beyond general variants of “an abnormal deficiency of water.” We conducted a literature review of ecological drought studies (564 papers) to assess how ecologists describe and study drought. We found that ecologists characterize drought in a wide variety of ways (reduced precipitation, low soil moisture, reduced streamflow, etc.), but relatively few publications ( 32\%) explicitly define what are, and are not, drought conditions. More troubling, a surprising number of papers ( 30\%) simply equated “dry conditions” with “drought” and provided little characterization of the drought conditions studied. For a subset of these, we calculated Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index values for the reported drought periods. We found that while almost 90\% of the studies were conducted under conditions quantifiable as slightly to extremely drier than average, 50\% were within the range of normal climatic variability. We conclude that the current state of the ecological drought literature hinders synthesis and our ability to draw broad ecological inferences because drought is often declared but is not explicitly defined or well characterized. We suggest that future drought publications provide at least one of the following: (a) the climatic context of the drought period based on long-term records; (b) standardized climatic index values; (c) published metrics from drought-monitoring organizations; (d) a quantitative definition of what the authors consider to be drought conditions for their system. With more detailed and consistent quantification of drought conditions, comparisons among studies can be more rigorous, increasing our understanding of the ecological effects of drought.},

We found considerable genotypic differences between the two cultivars. Chemlali exhibited more tolerance to water stress, with a thicker palisade parenchyma, and a higher stomatal and trichome density. Chemlali leaves also revealed lower specific leaf area and had higher density of foliar tissue and lower reduction in net CO2 assimilation rate. The mechanisms employed by these two cultivars to cope with water deficit are discussed at the morpho-structural level. The morphological and structural characteristics of the leaves are in accordance with physiological observations and contribute to the interpretation of why the olive cv.

The plot is in mature secondary mixed deciduous forest 5 km south of Front Royal, Virginia, USA. The initial plot census enumerated 38 932 free-standing living stems and 29 991 living individuals ≥1 cm dbh comprising 62 species, 38 genera, and 26 families, along with an additional 1248 dead/missing standing stems, for a total of 40 180 stems. Dominant canopy trees include tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), hickories (Carya spp.), oaks (Quercus spp.), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and black gum (Nyssa sylvatica). Prominent understory components include spicebush (Lindera benzoin), pawpaw (Asimina triloba), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana), and eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis). Few species predominate numerically on the plot; seven species have {\textbackslash}textgreater1000 individuals (71.3\% of the total). Mean stand density was 1179 living individuals/ha, while mean basal area was 34.1 m2/ha. Of the total plot area, 4 ha have had white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) exclusion since 1990. Woody seedling surveys from 2010–2012 in 354 1-m2 plots measured 19 415 seedlings of 47 species, from new germinants up to 1 cm dbh. Community-wide seed rain data from 200 0.5-m2 litterfall traps yielded a total of 9197 records from 37 species. Long-term seed data collected from 1986–2011 for Quercus and Carya within the exclosure and two replicate sites are also presented, documenting considerable annual variation in mast production. Dendrochronological data from 492 tree cores suggested the major canopy trees established circa 1900, but scattered trees of several species existed earlier. Large-scale forest dynamics plots employing standardized methodology have a long, rich history in the tropics. Similar plots in the temperate zone have been largely lacking, however. The SCBI plot represents one of the first of its kind in the Smithsonian Global Earth Observatory's recently established network of such plots, complementing its well-known network of tropical forest plots and enabling comparative studies on forest ecology and climate change at the global scale.},

The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850–2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1° and 1.5°C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

	abstract = {Drought disproportionately affects larger trees in tropical forests, but implications for forest composition and carbon (C) cycling in relation to dry season intensity remain poorly understood. In order to characterize how C cycling is shaped by tree size and drought adaptations and how these patterns relate to spatial and temporal variation in water deficit, we analyze data from three forest dynamics plots spanning a moisture gradient in Panama that have experienced El Niño droughts. At all sites, aboveground C cycle contributions peaked below 50-cm stem diameter, with stems ≥ 50 cm accounting for on average 59\% of live aboveground biomass, 45\% of woody productivity and 49\% of woody mortality. The dominance of drought-avoidance strategies increased interactively with stem diameter and dry season intensity. Although size-related C cycle contributions did not vary systematically across the moisture gradient under nondrought conditions, woody mortality of larger trees was disproportionately elevated under El Niño drought stress. Thus, large ({\textgreater} 50 cm) stems, which strongly mediate but do not necessarily dominate C cycling, have drought adaptations that compensate for their more challenging hydraulic environment, particularly in drier climates. However, these adaptations do not fully buffer the effects of severe drought, and increased large tree mortality dominates ecosystem-level drought responses.},

We combined new and existing data to build a database of 140 tree-ring chronologies to investigate patterns in growth–climate relationships. Our novel meta-analysis approach has allowed the first investigation of the effect of climate on tree growth across the entire geographical distribution of the species. We identified key climate signals in tree-ring chronologies and then investigated how these varied geographically and according to mean local climate, and by tree age and size. We found that the most important climate variables significantly correlated with growth did not show strong geographical patterns. Growth of trees in the core and at the southern edge of the distribution was reduced by high temperature and low precipitation during the growing season, and by high temperatures in the previous summer. However, growth of trees growing in warmer and drier locations was more frequently significantly correlated with summer precipitation than other populations. Additionally, the growth of older and larger trees was more frequently significantly correlated with previous summer temperature than younger and smaller trees. Trees growing at the south of the species geographical distributions are often considered most at risk from climate change, but our results indicate that radial growth of populations in other areas of the distribution is equally likely to be significantly correlated with summer climate and may also be vulnerable. Additionally, tree-rings from older trees contain particular growth–climate relationships that are rarely found in younger trees. These results have important implications for predicting forest carbon balance, resource use and likely future changes to forest composition across the continent.},

	abstract = {Understanding how tree size impacts leaf- and crown-level gas exchange is essential to predicting forest yields and carbon and water budgets. The stable carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) of organic matter has been used to examine the relationship of gas exchange to tree size for a host of species because it carries a temporally integrated signature of foliar photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. The carbon isotope composition of leaves reflects discrimination against 13C relative to 12C during photosynthesis and is the net result of the balance of change in CO2 supply and demand at the sites of photosynthesis within the leaf mesophyll. Interpreting the patterns of changes in δ13C with tree size are not always clear, however, because multiple factors that regulate gas exchange and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) co-vary with height, such as solar irradiance and hydraulic conductance. Here we review 36 carbon isotope datasets from 38 tree species and conclude that there is a consistent, linear decline of Δ with height. The most parsimonious explanation of this result is that gravitational constraints on maximum leaf water potential set an ultimate boundary on the shape and sign of the relationship. These hydraulic constraints are manifest both over the long term through impacts on leaf structure, and over diel periods via impacts on stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and leaf hydraulic conductance. Shading induces a positive offset to the linear decline, consistent with light limitations reducing carbon fixation and increasing partial pressures of CO2 inside of the leaf, p c at a given height. Biome differences between tropical and temperate forests were more important in predicting Δ and its relationship to height than wood type associated with being an angiosperm or gymnosperm. It is not yet clear how leaf internal conductance varies with leaf mass area, but some data in particularly tall, temperate conifers suggest that photosynthetic capacity may not vary dramatically with height when compared between tree-tops, while stomatal and leaf internal conductances do decline in unison with height within canopy gradients. It is also clear that light is a critical variable low in the canopy, whereas hydrostatic constraints dominate the relationship between Δ and height in the upper canopy. The trend of increasing maximum height with decreasing minimum Δ suggests that trees that become particularly tall may be adapted to tolerate particularly low values of p c.},

Forests store the majority of terrestrial carbon, thus their loss may have significant and sustained impacts on the global carbon cycle11,12. We use a hydraulic corollary to Darcy’s law, a core principle of vascular plant physiology13, to predict characteristics of plants that will survive and die during drought under warmer future climates. Plants that are tall with isohydric stomatal regulation, low hydraulic conductance, and high leaf area are most likely to die from future drought stress. Thus, tall trees of old-growth forests are at the greatest risk of loss, which has ominous implications for terrestrial carbon storage. This application of Darcy’s law indicates today’s forests generally should be replaced by shorter and more xeric plants, owing to future warmer droughts and associated wildfires and pest attacks. The Darcy’s corollary also provides a simple, robust framework for informing forest management interventions needed to promote the survival of current forests. Given the robustness of Darcy’s law for predictions of vascular plant function, we conclude with high certainty that today’s forests are going to be subject to continued increases in mortality rates that will result in substantial reorganization of their structure and carbon storage.},

Trees greater than approximately 6-m-tall exhibited more branch damage, larger numbers of dead individuals, higher wood density, greater leaf mass per area, lower leaf area to sapwood area ratio (LA/SA), lower stomatal conductance and lower net CO(2) assimilation than small trees. Stem-specific hydraulic conductivity decreased, while leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity remained nearly constant, with increasing tree size because of lower LA/SA in larger trees. Leaves were substantially more vulnerable to embolism than stems. Large trees had lower maximum leaf hydraulic conductance (K(leaf)) than small trees and all tree sizes exhibited lower K(leaf) at midday than at dawn. These size-related adjustments in hydraulic architecture and carbon allocation apparently incurred a large physiological cost: large trees received a lower return in carbon gain from their investment in stem and leaf biomass compared with small trees. Additionally, large trees may experience more severe water deficits in dry years due to lower capacity for buffering the effects of hydraulic path-length and soil water deficits.},

Precisely quantifying and mapping deciduousness in tropical forests will be necessary for calibrating remote sensing images which attempt to assess canopy properties such as carbon cycling, productivity, or chlorophyll content. We thus set out to assess the degree of canopy deciduousness in three moist, semi-deciduous tropical forests in central Panama. One site is a 6-ha research plot near the Atlantic coast of Panama, where rainfall is 2830 mm/yr. The second site is a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, near the center of the isthmus of Panama, where rainfall is 2570 mm/yr, and the final site is a 4-ha plot near the Pacific coast of Panama, where rainfall is 2060 mm/yr. At each site, a random sample of trees from all canopy species (those with individuals ≥ 30 cm DBH) were visited and scored for deciduousness three times during the 1997 dry season. The estimated peak fraction of deciduous individuals in the canopy at the wetter site was 4.8\%, at the intermediate site, 6.3\%, and at the drier site, 24.3\%. The estimated fraction of crown area deciduous peaked at 3.6\%, 9.7\%, and 19.1\% at the wet, medium, and dry sites respectively. The percentage of canopy species that was deciduous –14\%, 28\%, and 41\%–was much higher than the percentage of deciduous individuals, because not all individuals of deciduous species were deciduous. During the 1999 dry season, every individual of all the deciduous species was visited at the two drier sites, and the total number of deciduous trees observed closely matched the estimated numbers based on the smaller 1997 samples.},

	abstract = {Leaf shrinkage with dehydration has attracted attention for over 100 years, especially as it becomes visibly extreme during drought. However, little has been known of its correlation with physiology. Computer simulations of the leaf hydraulic system showed that a reduction of hydraulic conductance of the mesophyll pathways outside the xylem would cause a strong decline of leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf). For 14 diverse species, we tested the hypothesis that shrinkage during dehydration (i.e. in whole leaf, cell and airspace thickness, and leaf area) is associated with reduction in Kleaf at declining leaf water potential (Ψleaf). We tested hypotheses for the linkage of leaf shrinkage with structural and physiological water relations parameters, including modulus of elasticity, osmotic pressure at full turgor, turgor loss point (TLP), and cuticular conductance. Species originating from moist habitats showed substantial shrinkage during dehydration before reaching TLP, in contrast with species originating from dry habitats. Across species, the decline of Kleaf with mild dehydration (i.e. the initial slope of the Kleaf versus Ψleaf curve) correlated with the decline of leaf thickness (the slope of the leaf thickness versus Ψleaf curve), as expected based on predictions from computer simulations. Leaf thickness shrinkage before TLP correlated across species with lower modulus of elasticity and with less negative osmotic pressure at full turgor, as did leaf area shrinkage between full turgor and oven desiccation. These findings point to a role for leaf shrinkage in hydraulic decline during mild dehydration, with potential impacts on drought adaptation for cells and leaves, influencing plant ecological distributions.},

Plant drought tolerance is determined by multiple traits, but the relationships among traits, either within individual plants or across species, have not been evaluated for general patterns across plant diversity. We synthesized the published data for stomatal closure, wilting, declines in hydraulic conductivity in the leaves, stems, and roots, and plant mortality for 262 woody angiosperm and 48 gymnosperm species. We evaluated the correlations among the drought tolerance traits across species, and the general sequence of water potential thresholds for these traits within individual plants. The trait correlations across species provide a framework for predicting plant responses to a wide range of water stress from one or two sampled traits, increasing the ability to rapidly characterize drought tolerance across diverse species. Analyzing these correlations also identified correlations among the leaf and stem hydraulic traits and the wilting point, or turgor loss point, beyond those expected from shared ancestry or independent associations with water stress alone. Further, on average, the angiosperm species generally exhibited a sequence of drought tolerance traits that is expected to limit severe tissue damage during drought, such as wilting and substantial stem embolism. This synthesis of the relationships among the drought tolerance traits provides crucial, empirically supported insight into representing variation in multiple traits in models of plant and ecosystem responses to drought.},

	abstract = {The application of functional traits to predict and explain plant species’ distributions and vital rates has been a major direction in functional ecology for decades, yet numerous physiological traits have not yet been incorporated into the approach. Using commonly measured traits such as leaf mass per area (LMA) and wood density (WD), and additional traits related to water transport, gas exchange and resource economics, including leaf vein, stomatal and wilting traits, we tested hypotheses for Hawaiian wet montane and lowland dry forests (MWF and LDF, respectively): (1) Forests would differ in a wide range of traits as expected from contrasting adaptation; (2) trait values would be more convergent among dry than wet forest species due to the stronger environmental filtering; (3) traits would be intercorrelated within “modules” supporting given functions; (4) relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality rate (m) would correlate with a number of specific traits; with (5) stronger relationships when stratifying by tree size; and (6) RGR and m can be strongly explained from trait-based models. The MWF species’ traits were associated with adaptation to high soil moisture and nutrient supply and greater shade tolerance, whereas the LDF species’ traits were associated with drought tolerance. Thus, on average, MWF species achieved higher maximum heights than LDF species and had leaves with larger epidermal cells, higher maximum stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation rate, lower vein lengths per area, higher saturated water content and greater shrinkage when dry, lower dry matter content, higher phosphorus concentration, lower nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, high chlorophyll to nitrogen ratio, high carbon isotope discrimination, high stomatal conductance to nitrogen ratio, less negative turgor loss point and lower WD. Functional traits were more variable in the MWF than LDF, were correlated within modules, and predicted species’ RGR and m across forests, with stronger relationships when stratifying by tree size. Models based on multiple traits predicted vital rates across forests (R2 = 0.70–0.72; p {\textless} 0.01). Our findings are consistent with a powerful role of broad suites of functional traits in contributing to forest species’ distributions, integrated plant design and vital rates.

	abstract = {Projected changes in temperature and drought regime are likely to reduce carbon (C) storage in forests, thereby amplifying rates of climate change. While such reductions are often presumed to be greatest in semi-arid forests that experience widespread tree mortality, the consequences of drought may also be important in temperate mesic forests of Eastern North America (ENA) if tree growth is significantly curtailed by drought. Investigations of the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity are critically needed to accurately predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We matched site factors with the growth responses to drought of 10,753 trees across mesic forests of ENA, representing 24 species and 346 stands, to determine the broad-scale drivers of drought sensitivity for the dominant trees in ENA. Here we show that two factors—the timing of drought, and the atmospheric demand for water (i.e., local potential evapotranspiration; PET)—are stronger drivers of drought sensitivity than soil and stand characteristics. Drought-induced reductions in tree growth were greatest when the droughts occurred during early-season peaks in radial growth, especially for trees growing in the warmest, driest regions (i.e., highest PET). Further, mean species trait values (rooting depth and ψ50) were poor predictors of drought sensitivity, as intraspecific variation in sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in 17 of 24 species. From a general circulation model ensemble, we find that future increases in early-season PET may exacerbate these effects, and potentially offset gains in C uptake and storage in ENA owing to other global change factors.},

Methods of computing this index differ primarily in the way the upslope contributing area is calculated. In this study we compared a number of calculation methods for TWI and evaluated them in terms of their correlation with the following measured variables: vascular plant species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, soil moisture, and a constructed wetness degree. The TWI was calculated by varying six parameters affecting the distribution of accumulated area among downslope cells and by varying the way the slope was calculated. All possible combinations of these parameters were calculated for two separate boreal forest sites in northern Sweden. We did not find a calculation method that performed best for all measured variables; rather the best methods seemed to be variable and site specific. However, we were able to identify some general characteristics of the best methods for different groups of measured variables. The results provide guiding principles for choosing the best method for estimating species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, and soil moisture by the TWI derived from digital elevation models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A hydrological forecasting model is presented that attempts to combine the important distributed effects of channel network topology and dynamic contributing areas with the advantages of simple lumped parameter basin models. Quick response flow is predicted from a storage/contributing area relationship derived analytically from the topographic structure of a unit within a basin. Average soil water response is represented by a constant leakage infiltration store and an exponential subsurface water store. A simple non-linear routing procedure related to the link frequency distribution of the channel network completes the model and allows distinct basin sub-units, such as headwater and sideslope areas to be modelled separately. The model parameters are physically based in the sense that they may be determined directly by measurement and the model may be used at ungauged sites. Procedures for applying the model and tests with data from the Crimple Beck basin are described. Using only measured and estimated parameter values, without optimization, the model makes satisfactory predictions of basin response. The modular form of the model structure should allow application over a range of small and medium sized basins while retaining the possibility of including more complex model components when suitable data are available.},

	abstract = {1. Across plant species, drought tolerance and distributions with respect to water availability are strongly correlated with two physiological traits, the leaf water potential at wilting, that is, turgor loss point (πtlp), and the cell solute potential at full hydration, that is, osmotic potential (πo). We present methods to determine these parameters 30 times more rapidly than the standard pressure–volume (p–v) curve approach, making feasible community-scale studies of plant drought tolerance. 2. We optimized existing methods for measurements of πo using vapour-pressure osmometry of freeze-thawed leaf discs from 30 species growing in two precipitation regimes, and developed the first regression relationships to accurately estimate pressure–volume curve values of both πo and πtlp from osmometer values. 3. The πo determined with the osmometer (πosm) was an excellent predictor of the πo determined from the p–v curve (πpv,r2 = 0·80). Although the correlation of πosm and πpv enabled prediction, the relationship departed from the 1 : 1 line. The discrepancy between the methods could be quantitatively accounted for by known sources of error in osmometer measurements, that is, dilution by the apoplastic water, and solute dissolution from destroyed cell walls. An even stronger prediction of πpv could be made using πosm, leaf density (ρ), and their interaction (r2 = 0·85, all P {\textless} 2 × 10−10). 4. The πosm could also be used to predict πtlp (r2 = 0·86). Indeed, πosm was a better predictor of πtlp than leaf mass per unit area (LMA; r2 = 0·54), leaf thickness (T; r2 = 0·12), ρ (r2 = 0·63), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC; r2 = 0·60), which have been previously proposed as drought tolerance indicators. Models combining πosm with LMA, T, ρ, or LDMC or other p–v curve parameters (i.e. elasticity and apoplastic fraction) did not significantly improve prediction of πtlp. 5. This osmometer method enables accurate measurements of drought tolerance traits across a wide range of leaf types and for plants with diverse habitat preferences, with a fraction of effort of previous methods. We expect it to have wide application for predicting species responses to climate variability and for assessing ecological and evolutionary variation in drought tolerance in natural populations and agricultural cultivars.},

In this study, we assessed the responses to the 2010 drought of over 14,000 trees ≥10 cm dbh in a 25 ha lowland forest plot in the Colombian Amazon and how these responses varied among topographically defined habitats, with tree size, and with species wood density. Tree mortality was significantly higher during the 2010–2013 period immediately after the drought than in 2007–2010. The post-drought increase in mortality was stronger for trees located in valleys (+243\%) than for those located on slopes (+67\%) and ridges (+57\%). Tree-based generalized linear mixed models showed a significant negative effect of species wood density on mortality and no effect of tree size. Despite the elevated post-drought mortality, aboveground biomass increased from 2007 to 2013 by 1.62 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (95\% CI 0.80–2.43 Mg ha−1 yr−1). Biomass change varied among habitats, with no significant increase on the slopes (1.05, 95\% CI −0.76 to 2.85 Mg ha−1 yr−1), a significant increase in the valleys (1.33, 95\% CI 0.37–2.34 Mg ha−1 yr−1), and a strong increase on the ridges (2.79, 95\% CI 1.20–4.21 Mg ha−1 yr−1). These results indicate a high carbon resilience of this forest to the 2010 drought due to habitat-associated and interspecific heterogeneity in responses including directional changes in functional composition driven by enhanced performance of drought-tolerant species that inhabit the drier ridges.},

The effects of drought on forests along successional gradients remain poorly understood.

Average sap velocities and sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivities were highest in the youngest forest. During the dry season drought, sap velocities increased significantly in the 80-yr-old forest as a result of higher evaporative demand, but not in younger forests. The main drivers of transpiration shifted from radiation to vapor pressure deficit with progressing forest succession. Soil volumetric water content was a limiting factor only in the youngest forest during the dry season, probably as a result of less root exploration in the soil. Trees in early-successional forests displayed stronger signs of regulatory responses to the 2015–2016 El Niño drought, and the limiting physiological processes for transpiration shifted from operating at the plant–soil interface to the plant–atmosphere interface with progressing forest succession.},

	abstract = {Trees grow by vertically extending their stems, so accurate stem hydraulic models are fundamental to understanding the hydraulic challenges faced by tall trees. Using a literature survey, we showed that many tree species exhibit continuous vertical variation in hydraulic traits. To examine the effects of this variation on hydraulic function, we developed a spatially explicit, analytical water transport model for stems. Our model allows Huber ratio, stem-saturated conductivity, pressure at 50\% loss of conductivity, leaf area, and transpiration rate to vary continuously along the hydraulic path. Predictions from our model differ from a matric flux potential model parameterized with uniform traits. Analyses show that cavitation is a whole-stem emergent property resulting from non-linear pressure-conductivity feedbacks that, with gravity, cause impaired water transport to accumulate along the path. Because of the compounding effects of vertical trait variation on hydraulic function, growing proportionally more sapwood and building tapered xylem with height, as well as reducing xylem vulnerability only at branch tips while maintaining transport capacity at the stem base, can compensate for these effects. We therefore conclude that the adaptive significance of vertical variation in stem hydraulic traits is to allow trees to grow tall and tolerate operating near their hydraulic limits.},

The [CO2] within the vertical profile ranged from 320-350 ppm in the upper canopy to 405-560 ppm near the ground. The lowest and highest ambient [CO2] occurred during the day and during the night, respectively. This trend was observed consistently during the summer, but not when trees were leafless. Chlorophyll concentration was positively related to maximum photosynthetic rate within, but not among, species. Leaf senescence started from the inner part of the crown in alder and birch, but started either in the outer or top portion of the canopy of ash, basswood and maple. Chlorophyll (Chl) to nitrogen ratio in leaves increased with decreasing photon flux density. However, Chl b concentration in all species remained stable until the beginning of leaf senescence. Maximum photosynthetic rates observed in sun leaves of early successional species, gap phase or mid-successional species, and late successional species were 12.5-14.8 micromol m(-2) s(-1), 4.1-7.8 micromol m(-2) s(-1) and 3.1 micromol m(-2) s(-1), respectively.},

Station anomalies (from 1961 to 1990 means) were interpolated into 0.5° latitude/longitude grid cells covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), and combined with an existing climatology to obtain absolute monthly values. The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (frost day frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae. Time series for hemispheric averages and 20 large sub-continental scale regions were calculated (for mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation totals) and compared to a number of similar gridded products. The new dataset compares very favourably, with the major deviations mostly in regions and/or time periods with sparser observational data. CRU TS3.10 includes diagnostics associated with each interpolated value that indicates the number of stations used in the interpolation, allowing determination of the reliability of values in an objective way.

	abstract = {Abstract Climate change will affect tree species growth and distribution; however, under the same climatic conditions species may differ in their response according to site conditions. We evaluated the climate-driven patterns of growth for six dominant deciduous tree species in the southern Appalachians. We categorized species into two functional groups based on their stomatal regulation and xylem architecture: isohydric, diffuse porous and anisohydric, ring porous. We hypothesized that within the same climatic regime: (i) species-specific differences in growth will be conditional on topographically mediated soil moisture availability; (ii) in extreme drought years, functional groups will have markedly different growth responses; and (iii) multiple hydroclimate variables will have direct and indirect effects on growth for each functional group. We used standardized tree-ring chronologies to examine growth of diffuse-porous (Acer, Liriodendron, and Betula) and ring-porous (Quercus) species vs. on-site climatic data from 1935 to 2003. Quercus species growing on upslope sites had higher basal area increment (BAI) than Quercus species growing on mesic, cove sites; whereas, Acer and Liriodendron had lower BAI on upslope compared to cove sites. Diffuse-porous species were more sensitive to climate than ring porous, especially during extreme drought years. Across functional groups, radial growth was more sensitive to precipitation distribution, such as small storms and dry spell length (DSL), rather than the total amount of precipitation. Based on structural equation modeling, diffuse-porous species on upslope sites were the most sensitive to multiple hydroclimate variables (r2 = 0.46), while ring-porous species on upslope sites were the least sensitive (r2 = 0.32). Spring precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, and summer storms had direct effects on summer AET/P, and summer AET/P, growing season small storms and DSL partially explained growth. Decreasing numbers of small storms and extending the days between rainfall events will result in significant growth reduction, even in regions with relatively high total annual rainfall.},

	abstract = {Growth responses to twentieth century climate variability of the three main European tree species Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, and Pinus sylvestris within two temperate low mountain forest sites were analyzed, with particular emphasis on their dependence upon ecological factors and temporal stability in the obtained relationships. While site conditions in Central ({\textasciitilde}51°N, 9°E, KEL) and West (50.5°N, 6.5°E, EIF) Germany are similar, annual precipitation totals of ≅700 mm and ≅1,000 mm describe a maritime-continental gradient. Ring-width samples from 228 trees were collected and PCA used to identify common growth patterns. Chronologies were developed and redundancy analysis and simple correlation coefficients calculated to detect twentieth century temperature, precipitation, and drought fingerprints in the tree-ring data. Summer drought is the dominant driver of forest productivity, but regional and species-specific differences indicate more complex influences upon tree growth. F. sylvatica reveals the highest climate sensitivity, whereas Q. petraea is most drought tolerant. Drier growth conditions in KEL result in climate sensitivity of all species, and Q. petraea shifted from non-significant to significant drought sensitivity during recent decades at EIF. Drought sensitivity dynamics of all species vary over time. An increase of drought sensitivity in tree growth was found in the wetter forest area EIF, whereas a decrease occurred in the middle of the last century for all species in the drier KEL region. Species-specific and regional differences in long-term climate sensitivities, as evidenced by temporal variability in drought sensitivity, are potential indicators for a changing climate that effects Central-West German forest growth, but meanwhile hampers a general assessment of these effects.},

	abstract = {Catastrophic hydraulic failure will likely be an important mechanism contributing to large-scale tree dieback caused by increased frequency and intensity of droughts under global climate change. To compare the susceptibility of 22 temperate deciduous tree and shrub species to hydraulic failure during a record drought in the southeastern USA, we quantified leaf desiccation, native embolism, wood density, stomatal conductance and predawn and midday leaf water potential at four sites with varying drought intensities. At the two driest sites, there was widespread leaf wilting and desiccation, and most species exhibited predawn leaf water potentials of ≤3 MPa and {\textgreater}60\% loss of xylem conductivity in branches. Although species with high wood density were more resistant to cavitation, they had higher levels of native embolism and greater canopy dieback than species with low wood density. This unexpected result can be explained by the failure of species with dense wood to avert a decline in water potential to dangerous levels during the drought. Leaf water potential was negatively correlated with wood density, and the relationship was strongest under conditions of severe water deficit. Species with low wood density avoided catastrophic embolism by relying on an avoidance strategy that involves partial drought deciduousness, higher sensitivity of stomata to leaf water potential and perhaps greater rooting depth. These species therefore maintained water potential at levels that ensured a greater margin of safety against embolism. These differences among species may mediate rapid shifts in species composition of temperate forests if droughts intensify due to climate change.},

However, due to a lack of a quantitative global synthesis, it is still not clear whether drought-induced mortality rates differ among global biomes and whether functional traits influence the risk of drought-induced mortality. To address these uncertainties, we performed a global meta-analysis of 58 studies of drought-induced forest mortality. Mortality rates were modelled as a function of drought, temperature, biomes, phylogenetic and functional groups and functional traits. We identified a consistent global-scale response, where mortality increased with drought severity [log mortality (trees trees−1 year−1) increased 0.46 (95\% CI = 0.2–0.7) with one SPEI unit drought intensity]. We found no significant differences in the magnitude of the response depending on forest biomes or between angiosperms and gymnosperms or evergreen and deciduous tree species. Functional traits explained some of the variation in drought responses between species (i.e. increased from 30 to 37\% when wood density and specific leaf area were included). Tree species with denser wood and lower specific leaf area showed lower mortality responses. Our results illustrate the value of functional traits for understanding patterns of drought-induced tree mortality and suggest that mortality could become increasingly widespread in the future.},

	abstract = {We proposed the hydraulic limitation hypothesis (HLH) as a mechanism to explain universal patterns in tree height, and tree and stand biomass growth: height growth slows down as trees grow taller, maximum height is lower for trees of the same species on resource-poor sites and annual wood production declines after canopy closure for even-aged forests. Our review of 51 studies that measured one or more of the components necessary for testing the hypothesis showed that taller trees differ physiologically from shorter, younger trees. Stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs), photosynthesis (A) and leaf-specific hydraulic conductance (KL) are often, but not always, lower in taller trees. Additionally, leaf mass per area is often greater in taller trees, and leaf area:sapwood area ratio changes with tree height. We conclude that hydraulic limitation of gas exchange with increasing tree size is common, but not universal. Where hydraulic limitations to A do occur, no evidence supports the original expectation that hydraulic limitation of carbon assimilation is sufficient to explain observed declines in wood production. Any limit to height or height growth does not appear to be related to the so-called age-related decline in wood production of forests after canopy closure. Future work on this problem should explicitly link leaf or canopy gas exchange with tree and stand growth, and consider a more fundamental assumption: whether tree biomass growth is limited by carbon availability.},

Using meta-analysis, we show fine root biomass scales isometrically against leaf biomass both at the individual tree and stand level. However, despite isometric scaling between stem and coarse root production, fine root production scales against leaf production with a slope of about 0.8 at the stand level, which probably results from more rapid increase of turnover rate in leaves than in fine roots.

	abstract = {Metabolic scaling theory predicts how tree water flow rate (Q) scales with tree mass (M) and assumes identical scaling for biomass growth rate (G) with M. Analytic models have derived general scaling expectations from proposed optima in the rate of axial xylem conduit taper (taper function) and the allocation of wood space to water conduction (packing function). Recent predictions suggest G and Q scale with M to the ≈ 0·7 power with 0·75 as an upper bound. We complement this a priori optimization approach with a numerical model that incorporates species-specific taper and packing functions, plus additional empirical inputs essential for predicting Q (effects of gravity, tree size, heartwood, bark, and hydraulic resistance of leaf, root and interconduit pits). Traits are analysed individually, and in ensemble across tree types, to define a 2D ‘scaling space’ of absolute Q vs. its scaling exponent with tree size. ll traits influenced Q and many affected its scaling with M. Constraints driving the optimization of taper or packing functions, or any other trait, can be relaxed via compensatory changes in other traits. The scaling space of temperate trees overlapped despite diverse anatomy and winter-adaptive strategies. More conducting space in conifer wood compensated for narrow tracheids; extensive sapwood in diffuse-porous trees compensated for narrow vessels; and limited sapwood in ring-porous trees negated the effect of large vessels. Tropical trees, however, achieved the greatest Q and steepest size-scaling by pairing large vessels with extensive sapwood, a combination compatible with minimal water stress and no freezing-stress. Intraspecific scaling across all types averaged Q ∝ M 0·63 (maximum = Q ∝ M 0·71) for size-invariant root–shoot ratio. Scaling reached Q ∝ M 0·75 only if conductance increased faster in roots than in shoots with size. Interspecific scaling could reach Q ∝ M 0·75, but this may require the evolution of size-biased allometries rather than arising directly from biophysical constraints. Our species-level model is more realistic than its analytical predecessors and provides a tool for interpreting the adaptive significance of functional trait diversification in relation to whole-tree water use and consequent metabolic scaling.},

PHS updates vegetation water stress and root water uptake to better reflect plant hydraulic theory, advancing the physical basis of the model. The new configuration introduces prognostic vegetation water potential, modeled at the root, stem, and leaf levels. Leaf water potential replaces soil potential as the basis for stomatal conductance water stress, and root water potential is used to implement hydraulic root water uptake, replacing a transpiration partitioning function. Point simulations of a tropical forest site (Caxiuanã, Brazil) under ambient conditions and partial precipitation exclusion highlight the differences between PHS and the previous CLM implementation. Model description and simulation results are contextualized with a list of benefits and limitations of the new model formulation, including hypotheses that were not testable in previous versions of the model. Key results include reductions in transpiration and soil moisture biases relative to a control model under both ambient and exclusion conditions, correcting excessive dry season soil moisture stress in the control model. PHS implements hydraulic gradient root water uptake, which allows hydraulic redistribution and compensatory root water uptake and results in PHS utilizing a larger portion of the soil column to buffer shortfalls in precipitation. The new model structure, which bases water stress on leaf water potential, could have significant implications for vegetation-climate feedbacks, including increased sensitivity of photosynthesis to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit.},

The independent DGVMs predicted ≥50\% loss of Northern Hemisphere NET by 2100, consistent with the NET findings for Southwest USA. Notably, the global models underestimated future mortality within Southwest USA, highlighting that predictions of future mortality within global models may be underestimates.

	abstract = {The Amazon forest is integral to the global climate system in part because of the high rate of rainfall recycling through tree transpiration and biodiversity (size and species composition). However, the partitioning of precipitation into evaporation, transpiration and runoff, has been quantified at only a few sites. At our study site in the central Amazon, annual rainfall in 2013 was 2302mm and latent heat flux measurements made using eddy covariance revealed that 1360mm (59\%) was returned to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. Runoff accounted for 41\% of the net ecosystem water loss. Combining annual xylem sap flux estimates with total stand sap wood area, we estimated annual stand transpiration rate to be 851mm (36\% of annual rainfall). Emergent canopy trees (diameter {\textgreater}30cm; average height of 28m) were responsible for the majority (71\%) of the transpired water flux, recycling potentially 26\% of the rainfall back to the atmosphere. By difference, we estimate that 510mm of intercepted rainwater (22\% of rainfall) was evaporated directly back to atmosphere from the canopy. Highest stand transpiration rates occurred during the dryer months due to both increased water vapor pressure deficit and the onset of new leaf flush. This study provides further evidence for convergent water use characteristics of tropical trees and highlights the importance of large trees in tropical moist forests. Large trees have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to drought-related mortality, and thus potentially will make up a critical component of the response of tropical forests to climate change.},

	abstract = {BackgroundClimate change triggered many studies showing that trends and events of environmental conditions can reduce but also accelerate growth at the stand and individual tree level. However, it is still rather unknown how climate change modifies the growth partitioning between the trees in forest stands.MethodsBased on long-term girth-tape measurements in mature monospecific and mixed-species stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) we traced the effect of the severe droughts in 2003 and 2015 from the stand down to the tree level.ResultsStand growth of Norway spruce decreased by about 30\% in the once-in-a-century drought 2015, while European beech was much more drought resistant. Water availability generally amplified size-asymmetric growth partitioning. Especially in case of Norway spruce water availability primarily fostered the growth of predominant trees, whereas drought favoured the growth of small trees at the expense of the predominant ones. We could not detect significant differences between mixed and monospecific stands in this regard.ConclusionsThe drought-induced reallocation of growth in favour of small trees in case of spruce may result from its isohydric character. We hypothesize that as small trees are shaded, they can benefit from the reduced water consumption of their sun-exposed taller neighbours. In case of beech, as an anisohydric species, tall trees suffer less and smaller trees benefit less under drought. The discussion elaborates the consequences of the water dependent growth allocation for forest monitoring, growth modelling, and silviculture.},

	abstract = {Water must be transported long distances in tall plants, resulting in increasing hydraulic resistance, which may place limitations on the maximum plant height (Hmax) in a given habitat. However, the coordination of hydraulic traits with Hmax and habitat aridity remains poorly understood. To explore whether Hmax modifies the trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and safety or how water availability might influence the relationship between Hmax and other hydraulic traits, we compiled a dataset including Hmax and 11 hydraulic traits for 1281 woody species from 369 sites worldwide. We found that taller species from wet habitats exhibited greater xylem efficiency and lower hydraulic safety, wider conduits, lower conduit density, and lower sapwood density, which were all associated with habitat water availability. Plant height and hydraulic functioning appear to represent a single, coordinated axis of variation, aligned primarily with water availability, thus suggesting an important role for this axis in species sorting processes.
Coordination between plant height and xylem traits is aligned with habitat aridity across the Earth’s terrestrial biomes.

	abstract = {Global warming is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of droughts in the twenty-first century, but the relative contributions from changes in moisture supply (precipitation) versus evaporative demand (potential evapotranspiration; PET) have not been comprehensively assessed. Using output from a suite of general circulation model (GCM) simulations from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, projected twenty-first century drying and wetting trends are investigated using two offline indices of surface moisture balance: the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). PDSI and SPEI projections using precipitation and Penman-Monteith based PET changes from the GCMs generally agree, showing robust cross-model drying in western North America, Central America, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and the Amazon and robust wetting occurring in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes and east Africa (PDSI only). The SPEI is more sensitive to PET changes than the PDSI, especially in arid regions such as the Sahara and Middle East. Regional drying and wetting patterns largely mirror the spatially heterogeneous response of precipitation in the models, although drying in the PDSI and SPEI calculations extends beyond the regions of reduced precipitation. This expansion of drying areas is attributed to globally widespread increases in PET, caused by increases in surface net radiation and the vapor pressure deficit. Increased PET not only intensifies drying in areas where precipitation is already reduced, it also drives areas into drought that would otherwise experience little drying or even wetting from precipitation trends alone. This PET amplification effect is largest in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, and is especially pronounced in western North America, Europe, and southeast China. Compared to PDSI projections using precipitation changes only, the projections incorporating both precipitation and PET changes increase the percentage of global land area projected to experience at least moderate drying (PDSI standard deviation of ≤−1) by the end of the twenty-first century from 12 to 30 \%. PET induced moderate drying is even more severe in the SPEI projections (SPEI standard deviation of ≤−1; 11 to 44 \%), although this is likely less meaningful because much of the PET induced drying in the SPEI occurs in the aforementioned arid regions. Integrated accounting of both the supply and demand sides of the surface moisture balance is therefore critical for characterizing the full range of projected drought risks tied to increasing greenhouse gases and associated warming of the climate system.},

These regions nevertheless experienced extended Medieval-era droughts that were more persistent than any historical event, providing crucial targets in the paleoclimate record for benchmarking the severity of future drought risks. We use an empirical drought reconstruction and three soil moisture metrics from 17 state-of-the-art general circulation models to show that these models project significantly drier conditions in the later half of the 21st century compared to the 20th century and earlier paleoclimatic intervals. This desiccation is consistent across most of the models and moisture balance variables, indicating a coherent and robust drying response to warming despite the diversity of models and metrics analyzed. Notably, future drought risk will likely exceed even the driest centuries of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1100–1300 CE) in both moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) future emissions scenarios, leading to unprecedented drought conditions during the last millennium.
Evidence suggests that Western North America will be drier at the end of the 21st century than any period of the last 1000 years.

	abstract = {Large-scale biogeographical shifts in vegetation are predicted in response to the altered precipitation and temperature regimes associated with global climate change. Vegetation shifts have profound ecological impacts and are an important climate-ecosystem feedback through their alteration of carbon, water, and energy exchanges of the land surface. Of particular concern is the potential for warmer temperatures to compound the effects of increasingly severe droughts by triggering widespread vegetation shifts via woody plant mortality. The sensitivity of tree mortality to temperature is dependent on which of 2 non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms predominates—temperature-sensitive carbon starvation in response to a period of protracted water stress or temperature-insensitive sudden hydraulic failure under extreme water stress (cavitation). Here we show that experimentally induced warmer temperatures (≈4 °C) shortened the time to drought-induced mortality in Pinus edulis (piñon shortened pine) trees by nearly a third, with temperature-dependent differences in cumulative respiration costs implicating carbon starvation as the primary mechanism of mortality. Extrapolating this temperature effect to the historic frequency of water deficit in the southwestern United States predicts a 5-fold increase in the frequency of regional-scale tree die-off events for this species due to temperature alone. Projected increases in drought frequency due to changes in precipitation and increases in stress from biotic agents (e.g., bark beetles) would further exacerbate mortality. Our results demonstrate the mechanism by which warmer temperatures have exacerbated recent regional die-off events and background mortality rates. Because of pervasive projected increases in temperature, our results portend widespread increases in the extent and frequency of vegetation die-off.},

We update a global tree mortality map and present a roadmap to a more holistic understanding of forest mortality across scales. We highlight priority research frontiers that promote: (1) new avenues for research on key tree ecophysiological responses to drought; (2) scaling from the tree/plot level to the ecosystem and region; (3) improvements of mortality risk predictions based on both empirical and mechanistic insights; and (4) a global monitoring network of forest mortality. In light of recent and anticipated large forest die-off events such a research agenda is timely and needed to achieve scientific understanding for realistic predictions of drought-induced tree mortality. The implementation of a sustainable network will require support by stakeholders and political authorities at the international level.},

	abstract = {Patterns, mechanisms, projections, and consequences of tree mortality and associated broad-scale forest die-off due to drought accompanied by warmer temperatures—“hotter drought”, an emerging characteristic of the Anthropocene—are the focus of rapidly expanding literature. Despite recent observational, experimental, and modeling studies suggesting increased vulnerability of trees to hotter drought and associated pests and pathogens, substantial debate remains among research, management and policy-making communities regarding future tree mortality risks. We summarize key mortality-relevant findings, differentiating between those implying lesser versus greater levels of vulnerability. Evidence suggesting lesser vulnerability includes forest benefits of elevated [CO2] and increased water-use efficiency; observed and modeled increases in forest growth and canopy greening; widespread increases in woody-plant biomass, density, and extent; compensatory physiological, morphological, and genetic mechanisms; dampening ecological feedbacks; and potential mitigation by forest management. In contrast, recent studies document more rapid mortality under hotter drought due to negative tree physiological responses and accelerated biotic attacks. Additional evidence suggesting greater vulnerability includes rising background mortality rates; projected increases in drought frequency, intensity, and duration; limitations of vegetation models such as inadequately represented mortality processes; warming feedbacks from die-off; and wildfire synergies. Grouping these findings we identify ten contrasting perspectives that shape the vulnerability debate but have not been discussed collectively. We also present a set of global vulnerability drivers that are known with high confidence: (1) droughts eventually occur everywhere; (2) warming produces hotter droughts; (3) atmospheric moisture demand increases nonlinearly with temperature during drought; (4) mortality can occur faster in hotter drought, consistent with fundamental physiology; (5) shorter droughts occur more frequently than longer droughts and can become lethal under warming, increasing the frequency of lethal drought nonlinearly; and (6) mortality happens rapidly relative to growth intervals needed for forest recovery. These high-confidence drivers, in concert with research supporting greater vulnerability perspectives, support an overall viewpoint of greater forest vulnerability globally. We surmise that mortality vulnerability is being discounted in part due to difficulties in predicting threshold responses to extreme climate events. Given the profound ecological and societal implications of underestimating global vulnerability to hotter drought, we highlight urgent challenges for research, management, and policy-making communities.},

	abstract = {Aim Information about climate stressors on tree growth is needed in order to assess the impacts of global change on forest ecosystems. Broad-scale patterns of climatic limitations on tree growth remain poorly described across eastern North American deciduous forests. We examined the response of broadleaf tree species to climate in relation to their taxonomy, functional traits and geographical location. Location Eastern North America (32–45° N; 70–88° W). Methods We used a network of 86 tree-ring width chronologies from eight species that cover a wide range of ecological and climatic conditions. Species were analysed individually or combined according to taxa and wood anatomical functional traits. We identified climate stressors through correlations between growth and climate (from 1916 to 1996). We also explored patterns in the climate responses of these species with two clustering techniques. Results We found strong correlations between water availability and growth for all species. With few exceptions, this drought stress was independent of taxonomy or wood anatomical functional group. Depending on latitude, however, different climatic drivers governed this common drought response. In the cool, northern part of our network, forest growth was most strongly limited by precipitation variability, whereas maximum temperature was a stronger limiting factor than precipitation in the wetter and warmer southern parts. Main conclusions Our study highlights the sensitivity of broadleaf temperate forests to drought stress at annual to decadal scales, with few species-specific differences. The roles of temperature and precipitation on drought-sensitivity differ at opposing ends of our subcontinental-scale network. The impact of future environmental changes on these forests will ultimately depend on the balance between temperature and precipitation changes across this latitudinal gradient.},

	abstract = {1 Although climatic variability is a strong driving force for forest dynamics, drought-induced mortality has generally received much less attention than other types of disturbance. 2 In 1998–99 northern Patagonia was affected by one of the most severe droughts of the 20th century, coinciding with a strong La Nina event, and this caused high mortality of Nothofagus dombeyi (coihue), the dominant tree species in Nahuel Huapi National Park. 3 Factors involved in determining this mortality of N. dombeyi were examined at both patch and tree level. Radial growth characteristics of killed trees and survivors were compared by dendrochronological analyses. Relationships between growth and climate were investigated using response function analysis. 4 At the tree scale, individuals with variable growth were more prone to die from drought than trees with more regular growth. Juveniles whose growth patterns showed sensitivity to climate were particularly likely to die. However, among both killed trees and survivors, older trees were less sensitive to climate. 5 Mean growth rate was a good predictor of mortality in adult trees, showing that trees with slower growth rate were more susceptible to drought. Susceptible trees may have been negatively affected by the drought that affected northern Patagonia in 1956–57. 6 These results underscore the importance of considering drought-induced tree mortality as a non-random mechanism influenced by site, previous stress/disturbance history, ontogeny, vigour, climatic sensitivity and physiology. Spatial patterns of extensive full and partial crown dieback, which are evident in many temperate forests worldwide, may reflect the superposition of these predisposing factors on strong/repeated interannual fluctuations of climate.},

Tree-ring chronologies and latewood δ13C were used to derive measures for drought reaction across trees of different dimensions: growth reduction associated with drought years, long-term growth/climate relations and stomatal control on photosynthesis. For Scots pine, growth/climate relations indicated a stronger limitation of radial growth by high summer temperatures and low summer precipitation in smaller trees in contrast to larger trees. This is corroborated by a stronger stomatal control on photosynthesis for smaller pine trees under average conditions. In dry years, however, larger pine trees exhibited stronger growth reductions. For Norway spruce, a significantly stronger correlation of tree-ring width with summer temperatures and summer precipitation was found for larger trees. Additionally, for Norway spruce there is evidence for a change in competition mode from size-asymmetric competition under conditions with sufficient soil water supply to a more size-symmetric competition under dry conditions. Smaller oak trees showed a weaker stomatal control on photosynthesis under both dry and average conditions, which is also reflected by a significantly faster recovery of tree-ring growth after extreme drought events in smaller oak trees. The observed patterns are discussed in the context of the limitation-caused matter partitioning hypothesis and possible species-specific ontogenetic modifications.},

	abstract = {Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.},

Large stand-level shifts underway in western forests already are showing the importance of interactions involving drought, insects, and fire. Diebacks, changes in composition and structure, and shifting range limits are widely observed. In the eastern US, the effects of increasing drought are becoming better understood at the level of individual trees, but this knowledge cannot yet be confidently translated to predictions of changing structure and diversity of forest stands. While eastern forests have not experienced the types of changes seen in western forests in recent decades, they too are vulnerable to drought and could experience significant changes with increased severity, frequency, or duration in drought. Throughout the continental United States, the combination of projected large climate-induced shifts in suitable habitat from modeling studies and limited potential for the rapid migration of tree populations suggests that changing tree and forest biogeography could substantially lag habitat shifts already underway. Forest management practices can partially ameliorate drought impacts through reductions in stand density, selection of drought-tolerant species and genotypes, artificial regeneration, and the development of multistructured stands. However, silvicultural treatments also could exacerbate drought impacts unless implemented with careful attention to site and stand characteristics. Gaps in our understanding should motivate new research on the effects of interactions involving climate and other species at the stand scale and how interactions and multiple responses are represented in models. This assessment indicates that, without a stronger empirical basis for drought impacts at the stand scale, more complex models may provide limited guidance.},

	abstract = {Recent forest diebacks, combined with threats of future drought, focus attention on the extent to which tree death is caused by catastrophic events as opposed to chronic declines in health that accumulate over years. While recent attention has focused on large-scale diebacks, there is concern that increasing drought stress and chronic morbidity may have pervasive impacts on forest composition in many regions. Here we use long-term, whole-stand inventory data from southeastern U.S. forests to show that trees exposed to drought experience multiyear declines in growth prior to mortality. Following a severe, multiyear drought, 72\% of trees that did not recover their pre-drought growth rates died within 10 yr. This pattern was mediated by local moisture availability. As an index of morbidity prior to death, we calculated the difference in cumulative growth after drought relative to surviving conspecifics. The strength of drought-induced morbidity varied among species and was correlated with drought tolerance. These findings support the ability of trees to avoid death during drought events but indicate shifts that could occur over decades. Tree mortality following drought is predictable in these ecosystems based on growth declines, highlighting an opportunity to address multiyear drought-induced morbidity in models, experiments, and management decisions.},

	abstract = {Aim Climate and disturbance alter forest dynamics, from individual trees to biomes and from years to millennia, leaving legacies that vary with local, meso- and macroscales. Motivated by recent insights in temperate forests, we argue that temporal and spatial extents equivalent to that of the underlying drivers are necessary to characterize forest dynamics across scales. We focus specifically on characterizing mesoscale forest dynamics because they bridge fine-scale (local) processes and the continental scale (macrosystems) in ways that are highly relevant for climate change science and ecosystem management. We revisit ecological concepts related to spatial and temporal scales and discuss approaches to gain a better understanding of climate–forest dynamics across scales. Location Eastern USA. Time period Last century to present. Major taxa studied Temperate broadleaf forests. Methods We review regional literature of past tree mortality studies associated with climate to identify mesoscale climate-driven disturbance events. Using a dynamic vegetation model, we then simulate how these forests respond to a typical climate-driven disturbance. Results By identifying compound disturbance events from both a literature review and simulation modelling, we find that synchronous patterns of drought-driven mortality at mesoscales have been overlooked within these forests. Main conclusions As ecologists, land managers and policy-makers consider the intertwined drivers of climate and disturbance, a focus on spatio-temporal scales equivalent to those of the drivers will provide insight into long-term forest change, such as drought impacts. Spatially extensive studies should also have a long temporal scale to provide insight into pathways for forest change, evaluate predictions from dynamic forest models and inform development of global vegetation models. We recommend integrating data collected from spatially well-replicated networks (e.g., archaeological, historical or palaeoecological data), consisting of centuries-long, high-resolution records, with models to characterize better the mesoscale response of forests to climate change in the past and in the future.},

Crucial in plant climate adaptation are the diameters of water-transporting conduits. Sampling 537 species across climate zones dominated by angiosperms, we find that plant size is unambiguously the main driver of conduit diameter variation. And because taller plants have wider conduits, and wider conduits within species are more vulnerable to conduction-blocking embolisms, taller conspecifics should be more vulnerable than shorter ones, a prediction we confirm with a plantation experiment. As a result, maximum plant size should be short under drought and cold, which cause embolism, or increase if these pressures relax. That conduit diameter and embolism vulnerability are inseparably related to plant size helps explain why factors that interact with conduit diameter, such as drought or warming, are altering plant heights worldwide.},

We calibrated our model using a glasshouse dry-down experiment and tested it using in situ monitoring data on seedling mortality from reforestation efforts. We then simulated hydraulic stress and mortality in seedlings within the Bitterroot River watershed of Montana. We show that cumulative hydraulic stress, its legacy and its consequences for mortality are predictable and can be modeled at local to landscape scales. We demonstrate that topographic controls on the distribution and availability of water and energy drive spatial patterns of hydraulic stress. Low-elevation, south-facing, nonconvergent locations with limited upslope water subsidies experienced the highest rates of modeled mortality. Simulated mortality in seedlings from 2001 to 2015 correlated with the current distribution of forest cover near the lower treeline, suggesting that hydraulic stress limits recruitment and ultimately constrains the low-elevation extent of conifer forests within the region.},

	abstract = {Amazonian droughts are predicted to become increasingly frequent and intense, and the vulnerability of Amazonian trees has become increasingly documented. However, little is known about the physiological mechanisms and the diversity of drought tolerance of tropical trees due to the lack of quantitative measurements. Leaf water potential at wilting or turgor loss point (πtlp) is a determinant of the tolerance of leaves to drought stress and contributes to plant-level physiological drought tolerance. Recently, it has been demonstrated that leaf osmotic water potential at full hydration (πo) is tightly correlated with πtlp. Estimating πtlp from osmometer measurements of πo is much faster than the standard pressure–volume curve approach of πtlp determination. We used this technique to estimate πtlp for 165 trees of 71 species, at three sites within forests in French Guiana. Our data set represents a significant increase in available data for this trait for tropical tree species. Tropical trees showed a wider range of drought tolerance than previously found in the literature, πtlp ranging from −1·4 to −3·2 MPa. This range likely corresponds in part to adaptation and acclimation to occasionally extreme droughts during the dry season. Leaf-level drought tolerance varied across species, in agreement with the available published observations of species variation in drought-induced mortality. On average, species with a more negative πtlp (i.e. with greater leaf-level drought tolerance) occurred less frequently across the region than drought-sensitive species. Across individuals, πtlp correlated positively but weakly with leaf toughness (R2 = 0·22, P = 0·04) and leaf thickness (R2 = 0·03, P = 0·03). No correlation was detected with other functional traits (leaf mass per area, leaf area, nitrogen or carbon concentrations, carbon isotope ratio, sapwood density or bark thickness). The variability in πtlp among species indicates a potential for highly diverse species responses to drought within given forest communities. Given the weak correlations between πtlp and traditionally measured plant functional traits, vegetation models seeking to predict forest response to drought should integrate improved quantification of comparative drought tolerance among tree species.},

	abstract = {Forest decline, or the premature loss of forest health, is a complex process not yet fully understood. Although reductions of radial growth have previously been recorded for individuals affected by decline, studies describing the whole range of growth patterns from decline-affected stands are rare. We used principal component analysis to identify dominant patterns of radial growth in eleven Nothofagus pumilio stands in northern Patagonia that show external manifestations of forest dieback. At most sites, dominant growth patterns significantly different from the stand mean growth chronology were identified using either ring widths or basal area increments (BAIs). Due to the pervasive trend of decreasing ring width with increasing tree diameter, patterns of tree growth related to forest decline are better captured using BAIs. Three dominant patterns of growth were identified at most sites: (1) trees with the highest rates of growth during the first decades of the 20th century started a sustained reduction in radial growth in early 1940s reaching the lowest increments in the late 20th century; (2) trees with low growth over most of the 20th century substantially increased their growth rates in the 1960s concurrent with the growth decline in the previous group, and (3) trees with intermediate growth rates until mid-20th century showed a subsequent 20–30year period with high rates of growth followed by a gradual reduction from the late 1980s to present. The onset of negative trends in radial growth associated with forest decline (patterns 1 and 3) occurs simultaneously at most stands. Contrary to expectations, large-dominant trees with the highest rates of growth seem to be the most severely affected by reductions in radial growth. These results are consistent with the concept of “decline disease stabilizing selection” where healthy dominant fast-growing trees in the forest are selectively affected by a combination of specifically detrimental factors. Dominant patterns at stand scale exhibit similar trends in radial growth between sites separated by more than 400km in northern Patagonia suggesting that meso- to macro-scale environmental forcings modulate regional forest decline. Our results challenge traditional sampling designs used in dendroecological and dendroclimatological studies. Traditional sampling strategies, mostly targeted to dominant, climate-sensitive trees, will over emphasize the 20th century negative trends in Nothofagus stand growth associated with the largest stand trees. Only by including all individuals within a plot, will sampling provide consistent tree-growth estimates that represent the entire population. Additionally, as endogenous stand dynamics are not clearly reflected in mean growth estimates, dominant growth patterns within a stand should be identified to correctly assess dynamic processes such as forest decline.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that greenhouse gas (GHG)-induced global warming may lead to increased surface aridity and more droughts in the twenty-first century due to decreased precipitation in the subtropics and increased evaporative demand associated with higher vapor pressure deficit under warmer temperatures. Some recent studies argue that increased water use efficiency by plants under elevated CO2 may reduce the evaporative demand and therefore mitigate the drying. Here we first discuss the model-projected changes in precipitation amount and frequency that affect the surface water balance and aridity and then the changes in actual and potential evapotranspiration under GHG-induced warming. The effects of the GHG-induced warming and changes in plants’ physiology under elevated CO2 on precipitation, soil moisture, and runoff are quantified and compared by analyzing different model experiments with and without the physiologic response. The surface drying effect of GHG-induced warming is found to dominate over the wetting effect of plants’ physiology in response to increasing CO2, leading to similar surface drying patterns in climate model simulations with or without the physiologic response in the twenty-first century. Part of the drying comes from increased dry spells (i.e., more dry days) and a flattening of the histograms of drought indices as GHGs increase, with the latter leading to widespread increases in hydrological drought even over areas with increasing mean runoff. Because of this, the change pattern of the mean cannot be used to represent drought changes. Consistent with the projected drying in the twenty-first century, recent analyses of model experiments suggest wetter land surfaces during the last glacial maximum, which implies that dusty air during cold glacial periods may have resulted from other factors, such as stronger winds and more dust sources, rather than drier land surfaces. Finally, the drying in the subtropics does not appear to be just a transient response to increased GHGs, as the warming and precipitation change patterns do not vary significantly over time in 500-year simulations with increased CO2 contents by a fully coupled climate model.},

	abstract = {Increasing frequency of extremely dry and hot summers in some regions emphasise the need for silvicultural approaches to increase the drought tolerance of existing forests in the short term, before long-term adaptation through species changes may be possible. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the potential of thinning for improving tree performance during and after drought. We used results from 23 experiments that employed different thinning intensities including an unthinned control and focused on the response variables: radial growth, carbon- and oxygen-isotopes in tree-rings and pre-dawn leaf-water potential. We found that thinning effects on the growth response to drought differed between broadleaves and conifers, although these findings are based on few studies only in broadleaved forests. Thinning helped to mitigate growth reductions during drought in broadleaves, most likely via increases of soil water availability. In contrast, in conifers, comparable drought-related growth reductions and increases of water-use efficiency were observed in all treatments but thinning improved the post-drought recovery and resilience of radial growth. Results of meta-regression analysis indicate that benefits of both moderate and heavy thinning for growth performance following drought (recovery and resilience) decrease with time since the last intervention. Further, growth resistance during drought became smaller with stand age while the rate of growth recovery following drought increased over time irrespective of treatment. Heavy but not moderate thinning helped to avoid an age-related decline in medium-term growth resilience to drought. For both closed and very open stands, growth performance during drought improved with increasing site aridity but for the same stands growth recovery and resilience following drought was reduced with increasing site aridity. This synthesis of experiments from a wide geographical range has demonstrated that thinning, in particular heavy thinning, is a suitable approach to improve the growth response of remaining trees to drought in both conifers and broadleaves but the underlying processes differ and need to be considered.},

However, we know little about how this variability is distributed and coordinated at different organizational levels. For six dominant tree species in northeastern Spain (three Fagaceae and three Pinaceae) we quantified the inter- and intraspecific variability of a set of traits along a water availability gradient. We measured leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen (N) concentration, carbon isotope composition in leaves (δ13C), stem wood density, the Huber value (Hv, the ratio of cross-sectional sapwood area to leaf area), sapwood-specific and leaf-specific stem hydraulic conductivity, vulnerability to xylem embolism (P50) and the turgor loss point (Ptlp). Differences between families explained the largest amount of variability for most traits, although intraspecific variability was also relevant. Species occupying wetter sites showed higher N, P50 and Ptlp, and lower LMA, δ13C and Hv. However, when trait relationships with water availability were assessed within species they held only for Hv and Ptlp. Overall, our results indicate that intraspecific adjustments along the water availability gradient relied primarily on changes in resource allocation between sapwood and leaf area and in leaf water relations.},

	abstract = {Premise of the Study Studies across diverse species have established theory for the contribution of leaf traits to plant drought tolerance. For example, species in more arid climates tend to have smaller leaves of higher vein density, higher leaf mass per area, and more negative osmotic potential at turgor loss point (πTLP). However, few studies have tested these associations for species within a given lineage that have diversified across an aridity gradient. Methods We analyzed the anatomy and physiology of 10 Ceanothus (Rhamnaceae) species grown in a common garden for variation between and within “wet” and “dry” subgenera (Ceanothus and Cerastes, respectively) and analyzed a database for 35 species for leaf size and leaf mass per area (LMA). We used a phylogenetic generalized least squares approach to test hypothesized relationships among traits, and of traits with climatic aridity in the native range. We also tested for allometric relationships among anatomical traits. Key Results Leaf form, anatomy, and drought tolerance varied strongly among species within and between subgenera. Cerastes species had specialized anatomy including hypodermis and encrypted stomata that may confer superior water storage and retention. The osmotic potentials at turgor loss point (πTLP) and full turgor (πo) showed evolutionary correlations with the aridity index (AI) and precipitation of the 10 species’ native distributions, and LMA with potential evapotranspiration for the 35 species in the larger database. We found an allometric correlation between upper and lower epidermal cell wall thicknesses, but other anatomical traits diversified independently. Conclusions Leaf traits and drought tolerance evolved within and across lineages of Ceanothus consistently with climatic distributions. The πTLP has signal to indicate the evolution of drought tolerance within small clades.},

	abstract = {Considerable uncertainty surrounds the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the composition and structure of Amazon forests. Building upon results from two large-scale ecosystem drought experiments in the eastern Brazilian Amazon that observed increases in mortality rates among some tree species but not others, in this study we investigate the physiological traits underpinning these differential demographic responses. Xylem pressure at 50\% conductivity (xylem-P50), leaf turgor loss point (TLP), cellular osmotic potential (πo), and cellular bulk modulus of elasticity (ε), all traits mechanistically linked to drought tolerance, were measured on upper canopy branches and leaves of mature trees from selected species growing at the two drought experiment sites. Each species was placed a priori into one of four plant functional type (PFT) categories: drought-tolerant versus drought-intolerant based on observed mortality rates, and subdivided into early- versus late-successional based on wood density. We tested the hypotheses that the measured traits would be significantly different between the four PFTs and that they would be spatially conserved across the two experimental sites. Xylem-P50, TLP, and πo, but not ε, occurred at significantly higher water potentials for the drought-intolerant PFT compared to the drought-tolerant PFT; however, there were no significant differences between the early- and late-successional PFTs. These results suggest that these three traits are important for determining drought tolerance, and are largely independent of wood density—a trait commonly associated with successional status. Differences in these physiological traits that occurred between the drought-tolerant and drought-intolerant PFTs were conserved between the two research sites, even though they had different soil types and dry-season lengths. This more detailed understanding of how xylem and leaf hydraulic traits vary between co-occuring drought-tolerant and drought-intolerant tropical tree species promises to facilitate a much-needed improvement in the representation of plant hydraulics within terrestrial ecosystem and biosphere models, which will enhance our ability to make robust predictions of how future changes in climate will affect tropical forests.},

Even in the apparently straightforward case of choosing between standard linear regression models, there does not yet appear to be consensus in the statistical ecology literature as to the right approach. We review recent works on model selection in ecology and subsequently focus on one aspect in particular: the use of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or its small-sample equivalent, . We create a novel framework for simulation studies and use this to study model selection from simulated data sets with a range of properties, which differ in terms of degree of unobserved heterogeneity. We use the results of the simulation study to suggest an approach for model selection based on ideas from information criteria but requiring simulation. We find that the relative predictive performance of model selection by different information criteria is heavily dependent on the degree of unobserved heterogeneity between data sets. When heterogeneity is small, AIC or are likely to perform well, but if heterogeneity is large, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) will often perform better, due to the stronger penalty afforded. Our conclusion is that the choice of information criterion (or more broadly, the strength of likelihood penalty) should ideally be based upon hypothesized (or estimated from previous data) properties of the population of data sets from which a given data set could have arisen. Relying on a single form of information criterion is unlikely to be universally successful.},

Most trees face several drought events during their life and therefore resilience to dry conditions may be crucial to long-term survival. We assessed how growth resilience to severe droughts, including its components resistance and recovery, is related to the ability to survive future droughts by using a tree-ring database of surviving and now-dead trees from 118 sites (22 species, {\textgreater}3,500 trees). We found that, across the variety of regions and species sampled, trees that died during water shortages were less resilient to previous non-lethal droughts, relative to coexisting surviving trees of the same species. In angiosperms, drought-related mortality risk is associated with lower resistance (low capacity to reduce impact of the initial drought), while it is related to reduced recovery (low capacity to attain pre-drought growth rates) in gymnosperms. The different resilience strategies in these two taxonomic groups open new avenues to improve our understanding and prediction of drought-induced mortality.},

Predicting forest mortality remains challenging because the physiological mechanisms causing mortality are not fully understood and empirical relations between climatology and mortality are subject to change. Here, we show that the temporal loss of resilience, a phenomenon often detected as a system approaches a tipping point, can be used as an early warning signal (EWS) to predict the likelihood of forest mortality directly from remotely sensed vegetation dynamics. We tested the proposed approach on data from Californian forests and found that the EWS can often be detected before reduced greenness, between 6 to 19 months before mortality. The EWS shows a species-specific relation with mortality, and is able to capture its spatio-temporal variations. These findings highlight the potential for such an EWS to predict forest mortality in the near-term.},

	abstract = {Flowering plants predominantly conduct water in tubes known as vessels, with vessel diameter playing a crucial role in plant adaptation to climate and reactions to climate change. The importance of vessels makes it essential to understand how and why vessel diameter, plant height, and other ecological factors are interrelated. Although shoot length is by far the main driver of variation in mean vessel diameter across angiosperms, much remains to be understood regarding the factors accounting for the abundant variation around the y-axis in plots of mean species vessel diameter against shoot length. Here, we explore the potential role of porosity types, wood density, leaf phenology, background imperforate tracheary element type, vasicentric tracheids, vascular tracheids, perforation plate type, and successive cambia in causing variation in the y-intercept or slope of the mean species vessel-diameter– and vessel-density–shoot-length associations at the shoot tip and base. We detected numerous cases of ecologically significant variation. For example, latewood vessels of ring porous species scale with a lower slope than earlywood, i.e., latewood vessels are relatively narrow in taller plants. This pattern is likely the result of selection favoring freezing-induced embolism resistance via narrow vessels. Wood density was negatively associated with vessel diameter, with low wood density plants having wider vessels for a given height. Species with scalariform perforation plates scale with a lower shoot base vessel-diameter–shoot-length slope, likely reflecting selection against scalariform plates in wide vessels. In other cases, functional groups scaled similarly. For example, species with successive cambia did not differ from those with conventional single cambia in their mean vessel-diameter–shoot-length scaling, rejecting our prediction that species with successive cambia should have narrower vessels for a given shoot length. They did, however, have fewer vessels per unit shoot cross-sectional area than plants of similar heights, likely because vessels have longer functional lifespans (and therefore are fewer) in species with successive cambia. Our methods illustrate how vessel diameter can be studied taking shoot length into account to detect ecologically important variation and construct theory regarding plant adaptation via the hydraulic system that includes plant size as a vital element.},

Features that occur in more than 75 \% of the records are: growth ring boundaries indistinct or absent, diffuse porosity, exclusively simple perforation plates, alternate intervessel pitting, and non-septate fibers. The geographic distribution of vessel element features found in this study is consistent with previous studies: ring porosity is a Northern Hemisphere adaptation; numerous, narrow, short vessel elements are more common in temperate regions than in tropical regions. Element size is related to habit, with few wide vessels being a syndrome that is virtually absent from shrubs and small trees. The co-occurrence of selected features, ones that earlier have been suggested to be correlated, was examined; e.g., tangential vessel arrangement and ring porosity, rare axial parenchyma and septate fibers, tracheids and exclusively solitary vessels that are of medium to wide diameter. Axial parenchyma features show geographic variation, with aliform to confluent parenchyma and bands more than 3 cells wide being primarily tropical in occurrence. Storied rays, crystals, and silica bodies are more common in the tropics than in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. For ray features, geographic patterns are less apparent. In Australia, incidences of some features (vestured pits, solitary vessels, radial/diagonal vessel arrangement) are influenced by the Myrtaceae being a major component of the flora. This paper is but a general overview. Information from the Inside Wood database when combined with detailed information on ecological and geographical distributions of species, and subjected to more robust statistical analyses can be used to address a variety of questions on the evolution of wood structure and the ecological and phylogenetic significance of suites of features.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

We quantified seasonal effects of understorey microclimate predictors describing canopy structure, canopy composition and topography (i.e., local factors) and the forest patch size and distance to the coast (i.e., landscape factors). Location Temperate forests in Europe. Time period 2017–2018. Major taxa studied Woody plants. Methods We combined data from a microclimate sensor network with weather-station records to calculate the difference, or offset, between temperatures measured inside and outside forests. We used regression analysis to study the effects of local and landscape factors on the seasonal offset of minimum, mean and maximum temperatures. Results The maximum temperature during the summer was on average cooler by 2.1 °C inside than outside forests, and the minimum temperatures during the winter and spring were 0.4 and 0.9 °C warmer. The local canopy cover was a strong nonlinear driver of the maximum temperature offset during summer, and we found increased cooling beneath tree species that cast the deepest shade. Seasonal offsets of minimum temperature were mainly regulated by landscape and topographic features, such as the distance to the coast and topographic position. Main conclusions Forest organisms experience less severe temperature extremes than suggested by currently available macroclimate data; therefore, climate–species relationships and the responses of species to anthropogenic global warming cannot be modelled accurately in forests using macroclimate data alone. Changes in canopy cover and composition will strongly modulate the warming of maximum temperatures in forest understories, with important implications for understanding the responses of forest biodiversity and functioning to the combined threats of land-use change and climate change. Our predictive models are generally applicable across lowland temperate deciduous forests, providing ecologically important microclimate data for forest understories.},

	abstract = {Little is known about partitioning of soil water resources in species-rich, seasonally dry tropical forests. We assessed spatial and temporal patterns of soil water utilization in several canopy tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, during the 1997 dry season. Stable hydrogen isotope composition (δD) of xylem and soil water, soil volumetric water content (θv), and sap flow were measured concurrently. Evaporative fractionation near the soil surface caused soil water δD to decrease from about –15‰ at 0.1 m to –50 to –55‰ at 1.2 m depth. Groundwater sampled at the sources of nearby springs during this period yielded an average δD value of –60‰. θv increased sharply and nearly linearly with depth to 0.7 m, then increased more slowly between 0.7 and 1.05 m. Based on xylem δD values, water uptake in some individual plants appeared to be restricted largely to the upper 20 cm of the soil profile where θv dropped below 20\% during the dry season. In contrast, other individuals appeared to have access to water at depths greater than 1 m where θv remained above 45\% throughout the dry season. The depths of water sources for trees with intermediate xylem δD values were less certain because variation in soil water δD between 20 and 70 cm was relatively small. Xylem water δD was also strongly dependent on tree size (diameter at breast height), with smaller trees appearing to preferentially tap deeper sources of soil water than larger trees. This relationship appeared to be species independent. Trees able to exploit progressively deeper sources of soil water during the dry season, as indicated by increasingly negative xylem δD values, were also able to maintain constant or even increase rates of water use. Seasonal courses of water use and soil water partitioning were associated with leaf phenology. Species with the smallest seasonal variability in leaf fall were also able to tap increasingly deep sources of soil water as the dry season progressed. Comparison of xylem, soil, and groundwater δD values thus pointed to spatial and temporal partitioning of water resources among several tropical forest canopy tree species during the dry season.},

Hydraulic optimality models suggest that vessels should widen predictably from stem tip to base, buffering hydrodynamic resistance accruing as stems, and therefore conductive path, increase in length. Data from 257 species (609 samples) show that vessels widen as predicted with distance from the stem apex across angiosperm orders, habits and habitats. Standardising for stem length, vessels are only slightly wider in warm/moist climates and in lianas, showing that, rather than climate or habit, plant size is by far the main driver of global variation in mean vessel diameter. Terminal twig vessels become wider as plant height increases, while vessel density decreases slightly less than expected tip to base. These patterns lead to testable predictions regarding evolutionary strategies allowing plants to minimise carbon costs per unit leaf area even as height increases.},

Strategies of tropical trees to adapt their hydraulic properties to a perhumid climate are not well studied, as is the impact of tree height on the hydraulic conductivity and vessel anatomy of tropical canopy trees. We analyzed the dependence of hydraulic architecture on tree height in several phylogenetically different canopy tree species growing under the non-seasonal wet climate of a lower montane rainforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. We determined leaf-specific conductivity (LSC), sapwood-area specific hydraulic conductivity (kS), and wood anatomy (vessel diameter and density) of sun-exposed twigs and of the trunk of 51 trees of eight abundant species ranging in tree height between 6.5 and 44m. LSC and kS significantly increased with tree height (radj2=0.50 and 0.46, respectively) as did mean vessel diameter. We found this trend consistent for both, trunk (radj2=0.61 ) and twig (radj2=0.47) xylem vessel diameters. In contrast, vessel density and tree height were significantly negative correlated in twigs but not in the trunks. We assume that in a tropical perhumid climate with prevailing high atmospheric humidity, it seems more advantageous for tall trees to promote a high hydraulic conductivity in the conducting tissue of both the trunk and the upper crown, rather than to minimize the risk of drought-induced xylem embolism. However, the tree size-effect as observed in our study has to be validated in a larger sample of tropical tree species before universal rules could be deduced.},

Ψtlp may indicate drought tolerance as plants, which maintain gas exchange at lower midday water potentials as soil water availability declines also have lower Ψtlp. We evaluated 17 species from seasonally dry habitats, representing a range of life-forms, under well-watered and drought conditions, to determine how Ψtlp relates to stomatal sensitivity (pre-dawn water potential at stomatal closure: Ψgs0) and drought strategy (degree of isohydry or anisohydry; ΔΨMD between well-watered conditions and stomatal closure). Although Ψgs0 was related to Ψtlp, Ψgs0 was better related to drought strategy (ΔΨMD). Drought avoiders (isohydric) closed stomata at water potentials higher than their Ψtlp; whereas, drought tolerant (anisohydric) species maintained stomatal conductance at lower water potentials than their Ψtlp and were more dehydration tolerant. There was no significant relationship between Ψtlp and ΔΨMD. While Ψtlp has been related to biome water availability, we found that Ψtlp did not relate strongly to stomatal closure or drought strategy, for either drought avoiders or tolerators. We therefore suggest caution in using Ψtlp to predict vulnerability to drought.},

However, most previous work has focused on gradual depletion and recharge of tree internal water reserves as soil water availability varies over seasonal cycles. This chapter focuses on the underappreciated role that internal water storage plays in stabilizing the physiological function of trees under the dynamic conditions that prevail over the course of a day. Capacitive discharge of water into the transpiration stream can buffer daily fluctuations in xylem tension, thereby diminishing the risk of xylem embolism and hydraulic failure under dynamic conditions. Intrinsic sapwood capaci­t­ance and reliance on stored water increase with tree size. An inverse relationship between sapwood capacitance and resistance to embolism across diverse woody species suggests that above a minimum threshold value of capacitance, the tree survives by using capacitance to provide hydraulic safety by buffering fluctuations in tension, rather by relying on xylem structural features that directly reduce vulnerability to embolism. Progress in understanding the physiological role of capacitance in trees is impeded by non-uniformity in the way capacitance is measured and expressed, preventing much of the available information from being synthesized. To remedy this, standard protocols are described for defining and expressing capacitance and water storage capacity.},

	abstract = {Forest canopies buffer climate extremes and promote microclimates that may function as refugia for understory species under changing climate. However, the biophysical conditions that promote and maintain microclimatic buffering and its stability through time are largely unresolved. We posited that forest microclimatic buffering is sensitive to local water balance and canopy cover, and we measured this effect during the growing season across a climate gradient in forests of the northwestern United States (US). We found that forest canopies buffer extremes of maximum temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), with biologically meaningful effect sizes. For example, during the growing season, maximum temperature and VPD under at least 50\% forest canopy were 5.3°C and 1.1 kPa lower on average, respectively, compared to areas without canopy cover. Canopy buffering of temperature and vapor pressure deficit was greater at higher levels of canopy cover, and varied with water balance, implying that buffering effects are subject to changes in local hydrology. We project changes in the water balance for the mid-21st century and predict how such changes may impact the ability of western US forests to buffer climate extremes. Our results suggest that some forests will lose their capacity to buffer climate extremes as sites become increasingly water limited. Changes in water balance combined with accelerating canopy losses due to increases in the frequency and severity of disturbance will create potentially non-linear changes in the microclimate conditions of western US forests.},

The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the spatiotemporal variation of Tleaf in a semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama and (2) create a season-specific empirical model to predict Tleaf in the canopy. To achieve this, we used a 42 m tall construction crane for canopy access and monitored the microenvironment within the canopy of mature, 20-35 m tall trees of 5 tropical tree species during the wet and the dry season. Tleaf was correlated to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the wet season but not in the dry season, possibly due to seasonal differences in wind speed, physiology, and canopy phenology. A structural equation model showed that Tleaf is best explained by air temperature (Tair) and PPFD in the wet season, whereas in the dry season, Tair alone predicted most of the variation in Tleaf. These results suggest the utility of an empirical approach to estimate Tleaf variability where simple meteorological data are available. This approach can be incorporated in future models of vegetation-atmosphere carbon and water exchange models of mature tropical forests with similar seasonality.},

	abstract = {Spatial patterns in trait variation reflect underlying community assembly processes, allowing us to test hypotheses about their trait and environmental drivers by identifying the strongest correlates of characteristic spatial patterns. For 43 evergreen tree species ({\textgreater}1 cm dbh) in a 20-ha seasonal tropical rainforest plot in Xishuangbanna, China, we compared the ability of drought-tolerance traits, other physiological traits, and commonly measured functional traits to predict the spatial patterns expected from the assembly processes of habitat associations, niche-overlap-based competition, and hierarchical competition. We distinguished the neighborhood-scale (0–20 m) patterns expected from competition from larger-scale habitat associations with a wavelet method. Species’ drought tolerance and habitat variables related to soil water supply were strong drivers of habitat associations, and drought tolerance showed a significant spatial signal for influencing competition. Overall, the traits most strongly associated with habitat, as quantified using multivariate models, were leaf density, leaf turgor loss point (πtlp; also known as the leaf wilting point), and stem hydraulic conductivity (r2 range for the best fit models = 0.27–0.36). At neighborhood scales, species spatial associations were positively correlated with similarity in πtlp, consistent with predictions for hierarchical competition. Although the correlation between πtlp and interspecific spatial associations was weak (r2 {\textless} 0.01), this showed a persistent influence of drought tolerance on neighborhood interactions and community assembly. Quantifying the full impact of traits on competitive interactions in forests may require incorporating plasticity among individuals within species, especially among specific life stages, and moving beyond individual traits to integrate the impact of multiple traits on whole-plant performance and resource demand.},

	abstract = {Plant hydraulic conductance, namely the rate of water flow inside plants per unit time and unit pressure difference, varies largely from plant to plant and under different environmental conditions. Herein the main factors affecting: (a) the scaling between whole-plant hydraulic conductance and leaf area; (b) the relationship between gas exchange at the leaf level and leaf-specific xylem hydraulic conductance; (c) the short-term physiological regulation of plant hydraulic conductance under conditions of ample soil water, and (d) the long-term structural acclimation of xylem hydraulic conductance to changes in environmental conditions are reviewed. It is shown that plant hydraulic conductance is a highly plastic character that varies as a result of multiple processes acting at several time scales. Across species ranging from coniferous and broad-leaved trees to shrubs, crop and herbaceous species, and desert subshrubs, hydraulic conductance scaled linearly with leaf area, as expected from first principles. Despite considerable convergence in the scaling of hydraulic properties, significant differences were apparent across life forms that underlie their different abilities to conduct gas exchange at the leaf level. A simple model of carbon allocation between leaves and support tissues explained the observed patterns and correctly predicted the inverse relationships with plant height. Therefore, stature appears as a fundamental factor affecting gas exchange across plant life forms. Both short-term physiological regulation and long-term structural acclimation can change the levels of hydraulic conductance significantly. Based on a meta-analysis of the existing literature, any change in environmental parameters that increases the availability of resources (either above- or below-ground) results in the long-term acclimation of a less efficient (per unit leaf area) hydraulic system.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the spatial variability in tropical forest structure and biomass, and the mechanisms that underpin this variability, is critical for designing, interpreting, and upscaling field studies for regional carbon inventories. We investigated the spatial structure of tropical forest vegetation and its relationship to the hydrological network and associated topographic structure across spatial scales of 10–1000 m using high-resolution maps of LiDAR-derived mean canopy profile height (MCH) and elevation for 4930 ha of tropical forest in central Panama. MCH was strongly associated with the hydrological network: canopy height was highest in areas of positive convexity (valleys, depressions) close to channels draining 1 ha or more. Average MCH declined strongly with decreasing convexity (transition to ridges, hilltops) and increasing distance from the nearest channel. Spectral analysis, performed with wavelet decomposition, showed that the variance in MCH had fractal similarity at scales of ∼30–600 m, and was strongly associated with variation in elevation, with peak correlations at scales of ∼250 m. Whereas previous studies of topographic correlates of tropical forest structure conducted analyses at just one or a few spatial grains, our study found that correlations were strongly scale-dependent. Multi-scale analyses of correlations of MCH with slope, aspect, curvature, and Laplacian convexity found that MCH was most strongly related to convexity measured at scales of 20–300 m, a topographic variable that is a good proxy for position with respect to the hydrological network. Overall, our results support the idea that, even in these mesic forests, hydrological networks and associated topographical variation serve as templates upon which vegetation is organized over specific ranges of scales. These findings constitute an important step towards a mechanistic understanding of these patterns, and can guide upscaling and downscaling.},

	abstract = {© Author(s) 2016. Forest ecosystem models based on heuristic water stress functions poorly predict tropical forest response to drought partly because they do not capture the diversity of hydraulic traits (including variation in tree size) observed in tropical forests. We developed a continuous porous media approach to modeling plant hydraulics in which all parameters of the constitutive equations are biologically interpretable and measurable plant hydraulic traits (e.g., turgor loss point πtlp, bulk elastic modulus ϵ, hydraulic capacitance Cft, xylem hydraulic conductivity ks,max, water potential at 50\% loss of conductivity for both xylem (P50,x) and stomata (P50,gs), and the leafg: sapwood area ratio Al: As). We embedded this plant hydraulics model within a trait forest simulator (TFS) that models light environments of individual trees and their upper boundary conditions (transpiration), as well as providing a means for parameterizing variation in hydraulic traits among individuals. We synthesized literature and existing databases to parameterize all hydraulic traits as a function of stem and leaf traits, including wood density (WD), leaf mass per area (LMA), and photosynthetic capacity (Amax), and evaluated the coupled model (called TFS v.1-Hydro) predictions, against observed diurnal and seasonal variability in stem and leaf water potential as well as stand-scaled sap flux. Our hydraulic trait synthesis revealed coordination among leaf and xylem hydraulic traits and statistically significant relationships of most hydraulic traits with more easily measured plant traits. Using the most informative empirical trait-trait relationships derived from this synthesis, TFS v.1-Hydro successfully captured individual variation in leaf and stem water potential due to increasing tree size and light environment, with model representation of hydraulic architecture and plant traits exerting primary and secondary controls, respectively, on the fidelity of model predictions. The plant hydraulics model made substantial improvements to simulations of total ecosystem transpiration. Remaining uncertainties and limitations of the trait paradigm for plant hydraulics modeling are highlighted.},
