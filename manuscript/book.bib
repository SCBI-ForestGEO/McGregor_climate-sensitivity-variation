	abstract = {Competition effects and management related disturbances can contribute to strong non-climatic signals in ring-width trends of trees from closed canopy forests. Removing this noise comes at the price of losing a considerable amount of (climatic) information on decadal and centennial time scales. Alternatively, open grown solitary trees, which never competed for light or other resources could function as less biased climate proxies. To explore this potential we analysed individual growth trends and climate-growth relationships of solitary oaks, potentially representative of former, open forests, and compared it to those of trees growing in adjacent closed canopy forests. Solitary oaks show differing tree allometry with bigger crowns and lower absolute heights. Their radial growth was significantly higher compared to forest trees. Contrary to our expectations, these solitary oaks show highly individualistic decadal growth trends. Their inter-annual variations are nevertheless in good agreement between individuals and stronger compared to trees from closed canopy forests. Climate –growth analysis revealed a significantly higher drought sensitivity of solitary oaks. Given the typical open medieval forest structure of large trees with extensive crowns growing in a mosaic of grazed woodlands and grasslands, it is likely that these trees contribute to the historical part of tree-ring collections. When trees from today’s denser forests forming the recent parts of the collections are used to calibrate reconstruction models, the differing drought sensitivity might therefore lead to an overestimation of historical droughts.},

	abstract = {1 Although climatic variability is a strong driving force for forest dynamics, drought-induced mortality has generally received much less attention than other types of disturbance. 2 In 1998–99 northern Patagonia was affected by one of the most severe droughts of the 20th century, coinciding with a strong La Nina event, and this caused high mortality of Nothofagus dombeyi (coihue), the dominant tree species in Nahuel Huapi National Park. 3 Factors involved in determining this mortality of N. dombeyi were examined at both patch and tree level. Radial growth characteristics of killed trees and survivors were compared by dendrochronological analyses. Relationships between growth and climate were investigated using response function analysis. 4 At the tree scale, individuals with variable growth were more prone to die from drought than trees with more regular growth. Juveniles whose growth patterns showed sensitivity to climate were particularly likely to die. However, among both killed trees and survivors, older trees were less sensitive to climate. 5 Mean growth rate was a good predictor of mortality in adult trees, showing that trees with slower growth rate were more susceptible to drought. Susceptible trees may have been negatively affected by the drought that affected northern Patagonia in 1956–57. 6 These results underscore the importance of considering drought-induced tree mortality as a non-random mechanism influenced by site, previous stress/disturbance history, ontogeny, vigour, climatic sensitivity and physiology. Spatial patterns of extensive full and partial crown dieback, which are evident in many temperate forests worldwide, may reflect the superposition of these predisposing factors on strong/repeated interannual fluctuations of climate.},

	abstract = {Global change is impacting forests worldwide, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services including climate regulation. Understanding how forests respond is critical to forest conservation and climate protection. This review describes an international network of 59 long-term forest dynamics research sites (CTFS-ForestGEO) useful for characterizing forest responses to global change. Within very large plots (median size 25 ha), all stems ≥1 cm diameter are identified to species, mapped, and regularly recensused according to standardized protocols. CTFS-ForestGEO spans 25°S–61°N latitude, is generally representative of the range of bioclimatic, edaphic, and topographic conditions experienced by forests worldwide, and is the only forest monitoring network that applies a standardized protocol to each of the world's major forest biomes. Supplementary standardized measurements at subsets of the sites provide additional information on plants, animals, and ecosystem and environmental variables. CTFS-ForestGEO sites are experiencing multifaceted anthropogenic global change pressures including warming (average 0.61 °C), changes in precipitation (up to ±30\% change), atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (up to 3.8 g N m−2 yr−1 and 3.1 g S m−2 yr−1), and forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape (up to 88\% reduced tree cover within 5 km). The broad suite of measurements made at CTFS-ForestGEO sites makes it possible to investigate the complex ways in which global change is impacting forest dynamics. Ongoing research across the CTFS-ForestGEO network is yielding insights into how and why the forests are changing, and continued monitoring will provide vital contributions to understanding worldwide forest diversity and dynamics in an era of global change.},

	abstract = {Tree mortality is one of the most influential drivers of forest dynamics, and characterizing patterns of tree mortality is critical to understanding forest dynamics and ecosystem function in the present era of global change. Here, we use a unique data set of mortality in a temperate deciduous forest to characterize rates and drivers of mortality. At the 25.6-ha Center for Tropical Forest Science—Forest Global Earth Observatory forest dynamics plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (Virginia, USA), we conducted two full tree censuses in 2008 and 2013 and then tracked mortality over the next 2 years (2014 and 2015). Overall, the mortality rate, m, of stems ≥10 cm diameter was 1.3–2.1\%/yr. Biomass mortality, M, was 1.9–3.4 Mg·ha−1·yr−1 at the stand level (0.6–1.1\%/yr of biomass), less than biomass gains from growth and recruitment, resulting in net live biomass accumulation. Small stems died at the highest rate; however, contributions to M increased toward larger size classes. Most species had m {\textless} 2\%/yr and M {\textless} 0.25 Mg·ha−1·yr−1 ({\textless}3\%/yr of biomass), whereas two to four species had anomalously high mortality rates during each census period, accounting for 15–24\% of m (n = 2, Cercis canadensis, Ulmus species) and 39–75\% of M (n = 4 Quercus species). Stems that died, whether or not in association with mechanical damage, tended to grow more slowly in preceding years than surviving stems and, for certain shade-intolerant species, tended to be in neighborhoods with higher basal area. These findings show how relatively fine-scale mortality processes contribute to stand-level compositional change and carbon cycling. The mortality patterns reported here will provide a valuable basis for understanding future disturbance events within eastern deciduous forests and for comparing across forest types.},

	abstract = {Forests provide essential ecosystem services and hold approximately 45\% of global terrestrial carbon. Estimates of the quantity and spatial distribution of global forest carbon are built on the assumption that regional- or national-scale allometry accurately captures growth form across the wide spectrum of plant size. Allometry is painstaking and costly to create: trees must be cut, dried, and weighed, over the span of months. This bottleneck has left most equations low in sample size and without large trees ({\textgreater}50 cm), which can contain over 40\% of aboveground carbon. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can potentially increase the range and sample size of allometric equations through non-destructive biomass estimation and must be evaluated in this context. We deployed TLS at the Center for Tropical Forest Science - Forest Global Earth Observatory (CTFS-ForestGEO) plot in Front Royal, Virginia and virtually reconstructed 329 trees with diameters up to 123 cm. Three-dimensional tree models were the basis for 22 local allometric relationships for comparison to the Jenkins et al. (2003) and Chojnacky et al. (2014) equations. Overall, TLS allometry had lower RMSE and predicted higher tree-level biomass compared to the equivalent national equations. We evaluated site-wide allometry for errors from insufficient sample size and diameter range. Allometric equations did not stabilize to a consistent set of parameters until 100–200 samples were reached and exclusion of large trees severely limited prediction accuracy. This work implies that current biomass equations may be inadequate and highlights TLS stem modeling as an appropriate method of non-destructive allometric equation development for updating allometry and reducing uncertainty in landscape-level biomass estimates.},

	abstract = {Tree height is a key variable for estimating tree biomass and investigating tree life history, but it is difficult to measure in forests with tall, dense canopies and wide crowns. The traditional method, which we refer to as the ‘tangent method’, involves measuring horizontal distance to the tree and angles from horizontal to the top and base of the tree, while standing at a distance of perhaps one tree height or greater. Laser rangefinders enable an alternative method, which we refer to as the ‘sine method’; it involves measuring the distances to the top and base of the tree, and the angles from horizontal to these, and can be carried out from under the tree or from some distance away. We quantified systematic and random errors of these two methods as applied by five technicians to a size-stratified sample of 74 trees between 5.7 and 39.2 m tall in a Neotropical moist forest in Panama. We measured actual heights using towers adjacent to these trees. The tangent method produced unbiased height estimates, but random error was high, and in 6 of the 370 measurements, heights were overestimated by more than 100\%. The sine method was faster to learn, displayed less variation in heights among technicians, and had lower random error, but resulted in systematic underestimation by 20\% on average. We recommend the sine method for most applications in tropical forests. However, its underestimation, which is likely to vary with forest and instrument type, must be corrected if actual heights are needed.},
