1966,202029,1.92,0.95,-0.97,arima better,short record prior to drought

1966,30174,0.93,1.56,0.63,resist better,this one's tricky
1966,190735,0.69,1.34,0.65,resist better ,this one's a bit tricky
1966,111166,0.51,1.54,1.03,resist much better,growth declining prior to drought
1977,20847,1.69,0.82,-0.87,arima better,quite variable/ growth phase at tome of drought
1977,200389,1.86,1.03,-0.83,arima better,tree in rapid growth phase
1977,20820,1.67,0.9,-0.77,arima better?,SOMETHING SEEMS WRONG HERE. I DON'T SEE HOW RESIST VALUE COULD BE SO HIGH
1977,60339,1.45,2.06,0.61,resist better,variable but increasing grwoth trend
