1.0. Drought resistance decreases with DBH,yes,yes,(yes),(no),Table 4
1.1a- Drought resistance decreases with height,yes,yes,(yes),(no/yes),"Tables 4, 5"
1.1b- Height is a better predictor of drought resistance than DBH,(yes),(no),(no),-,Table 4
1.2a- Crown position alone affects drought resistance (dominant trees suffer most),(yes),yes,(yes),(no),Table 4
"1.2b- After accounting for height, crown position affects drought resistance (dominant trees suffer most)",(no),(no),(yes),(no),"Tables 4, 5"
