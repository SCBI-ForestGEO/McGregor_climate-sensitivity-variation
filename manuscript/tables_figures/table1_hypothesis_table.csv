Hypotheses & Specific Predictions,Overall,1966,1977,1999,Results,,"*maybe I'm incorrect in this, but in table5, since all the models have dAICc <2, does that mean they all get parentheses around labels no and yes? This is the assumption that my comments below are operating on"
1.0- Drought resistance decreases with DBH.,yes,yes,(yes),(no),Table 4,,
1.1 - Drought resistance decreases with height.,yes,yes,(yes),(no),"Tables 4, 5","ln[H] coefficient is negative in all models from Table 5. How did you want to incorporate this when the current designations in this table refer to Table 4? (Specifically, 1999 is (no) but in all the best models from table 5 it's negative - does this mean it gets a (no/yes)?",
"1.2a - When CP is considered alone, dominant trees have lowest resistance.",(yes),yes,(yes),(no),Table 4,,
"1.2b - In models with CP and H, dominant trees have lowest resistance.",(no),(no),(yes),(no),"Tables 4, 5","in this case, the labels given from table4 match the evidence seen in table5 for each category",
1.3 - There is a negative interactive effect between H and TWI.,(no),(no),(no),(no),Table 4,,
2.1a - WD correlates positively to drought resistance.,(no),(no),(no),(yes),Table 4,,
2.1b - LMA correlates positively to drought resistance.,(yes),(yes),(no),(yes),Table 4,,
2.1c - Diffuse porous species have lower drought resistance.,(no),(no),(no),yes,"Tables 4, 5","same as above. In table4, diffuse is non-significantly not the lowest resistance, so it gets (no) for all years and 1966. But in table5, it is non-significantly the lowest. How would the (no) be changed to reflect this? Would it be (no/yes)? ","Also, for 1999 in table5, the label would be (yes), but for table4 it's yes. Should it be changed to be yes/(yes) ?"
2.1d  - PLA correlates negatively with drought resistance.,yes,yes,(yes),(yes),"Tables 4, 5","same as for diffuse above. Table5 is (yes), but table4 is yes for all years and 1966, so should it be changed for both of those to be yes/(yes)?",
2.1e - TLP correlates negatively with drought resistance.,(yes),(yes/no),(yes),(yes),"Tables 4, 5",,
2.2a - Community mean WD correlates positively to H.,no,-,-,-,Table S#,I'm unsure which table is this coming frm,

2.3 - Effect of H is negative when traits are included in the statistical model.,yes,yes,(yes),(yes),Table 5,all models have negative height in table5. Should these not all be yes without parentheses?,
3.1 - Drought year explains variation in drought resistance.,no,-,-,-,Table 4,,
3.2 - Directions of responses to best predictor variables differ across droughts.,rarely,-,-,-,"Tables 4,5",,
3.3 - Best predictor variables differ across droughts.,yes,-,-,-,Table 5,,
